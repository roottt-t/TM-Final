that	O

some	O

you	O

Is	O
it	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
slipped	B-Disease
vertabrae	I-Disease
and	O
a	O
degenerative	B-Disease
disk.	O
This	O
medicine	O
has	O
been	O
extrememly	O
helpful.	O
I	O
don't	O
take	O
it	O
daily,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
sign	O
of	O
a	O
flare	O
and	O
it	O
helps	O
almost	O
immediately.	O
I	O
tried	O
Relafen,	O
vicodine,	O
flexeril	B-Drug
and	O
OTC	O
pain	O
relief	O
and	O
nothing	O
has	O
helped	O
like	O
this.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
this	O
medication	O
for	O
approximately	O
two	O
years	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
affective	O
in	O
lowering	O
my	O
cholesterol;	O
however,	O
I	O
did	O
notice	O
that	O
I	O
became	O
depressed	B-ADR
with	O
intermittent	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain.	O
I	O
recently	O
mentioned	O
this	O
to	O
my	O
physician	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
if	O
this	O
particular	O
medication	O
causes	O
these	O
symptoms	O
as	O
all	O
my	O
blood	O
studies	O
for	O
liver	O
function,	O
etc	O
have	O
been	O
normal.	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
I	O
felt	O
so	O
much	O
better.	O
I	O
will	O
call	O
him	O
tomorrow	O
and	O
ask	O
if	O
I	O
can	O
be	O
switched	O
to	O
another	O
medication.	O
It	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
effective	O
medication,	O
but	O
obviously	O
has	O
its	O
problems	O
as	O
indicated	O
by	O
those	O
patients	O
who	O
had	O
very	O
similar	O
effects.	O

this	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
shot	O
at	O
using	O
a	O
statin	O
to	O
reduce	O
cholesterol	O
ldl.	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
all	O
the	O
statin	O
drugs,	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
very	O
expensive	O
drug	O
of	O
choice	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
doc's	O
out	O
there.	O
For	O
all	O
of	O
you	O
who	O
now	O
have	O
extremely	O
low	O
LDL	O
and	O
a	O
bad	O
case	O
of	O
joint	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
extent	I-ADR
that	I-ADR
it	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
arthritic	I-ADR
or	O
having	O
bad	O
muscle	B-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
that	O
you	O
never	O
got	O
prior	O
to	O
the	O
drug,	O
it	O
is	O
from	O
the	O
statins.	O
The	O
drug	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
decrease	O
LDL	O
through	O
a	O
mechanism	O
which	O
also	O
destroys	O
and	O
depletes	O
your	O
bodies	O
ability	O
to	O
make	O
CoQ10.	O
This	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
they	O
health	O
of	O
muscles	O
and	O
joints	O
(that's	O
why	O
you	O
are	O
experiencing	O
the	O
joint	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
and	O
numbness).	O
Remember	O
your	O
heart	O
is	O
a	O
muscle,	O
guess	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
to	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
depletion	O
of	O
the	O
CoQ10???	O
If	O
you	O
do	O
some	O
research	O
on	O
the	O
internet,	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
statins	O
make	O
no	O
claims/nor	O
have	O
studies	O
shown	O
them	O
to	O
reduce	O
heart	B-Disease
attacks,	O
but	O
they	O
cause	O
muscle	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
i.e.	O
your	O
heart,	O
this	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
put	O
younger	O
and	O
younger	O
people	O
on	O
these	O
drugs	O
and.	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
own	O
research	O
versus	O
just	O
listening	O
to	O
the	O
doctor	O
who	O
wants	O
your	O
LDL	O
down	O
to	O
like	O
below	O
130,	O
neurosurgeons,	O
who	O
have	O
studied	O
this	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
all	O
too	O
low.	O
And	O
just	O
because	O
your	O
test	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
show	O
your	O
liver	O
functions	O
are	O
fine	O
and	O
don't	O
show	O
any	O
broken	O
down	O
muscle	O
toxins	O
in	O
the	O
blood	O
doesn't	O
mean	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
CoQ10	O
isn't	O
breaking	O
down	O
and	O
damaging	B-ADR
your	I-ADR
muscles	I-ADR
very	O
slowly.	O
Mine	O
always	O

I	O

joints	I-ADR
(never	O

and	O
bad	O

(also	O
never	O

those	O
until	O

is	O
you	O

high	O
blood	O
pressure,	O
high	B-Disease
LDL,	O
over	B-Finding
weight	I-Finding
and	O
maybe	O

then	O
you	O
probably	O
need	O
something	O
to	O

the	O

if	O

you	O

of	O
the	O

i	O

this	O

i	O
already	O

how	O

i'm	O

and	O
can	O

my	I-ADR

great!!	O
:|.	O

I	O
used	O
to	O
take	O
Provachol	B-Drug
(sp?)but	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
caused	O
extreme	B-ADR
bloating.	O
It	O
also	O
seem	O
to	O
increase	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
heart	I-ADR
rate	I-ADR
therefore	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
sleep	I-ADR
well.	O
I	O
requested	O
to	O
take	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(10mg).	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
months	O
now.	O
I	O
will	O
go	O
for	O
a	O

within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
so	O
we'll	O
see	O
how	O
good	O
it	O
did	O
its	O
job.	O
As	O
far	O
as	O
side	O
effects	O
are	O
concerned,	O
I	O
find	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
also	O
causes	O
bloating	B-ADR
and	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
gas	B-ADR
build	O
up	O
although	O
not	O
as	O
badly	O
as	O
my	O
previous	O

I'm	O
finding	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
fit	O
into	O
my	O
clothes	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
bloating.	O
I	O
also	O
find	O
that	O
it	O
makes	O
me	O
a	O
bit	O
drowsy,	O
almost	O
like	O
a	O
sleeping	O
pill.	O
I	O
therefore	O
take	O
it	O
at	O
bedtime	O
but	O
my	O
sleep	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
not	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
sound	I-ADR
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
refreshing.	O
I	O
developed	O
a	O
pain	B-ADR
that	I-ADR
seems	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
originate	I-ADR
at	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
neck,	O
travel	O

and	O
then	O
run	O
to	O
my	O

I	O
first	O
attributed	O
this	O
to	O

because	O
I	O
do	O
a	O

I	O

perhaps	O
that	O
I	O

I	O
can	O

that	O
today	O
is	O
the	O
first	O

that	O
I	O

felt	O
really	O

I'll	O

will	O

My	O

After	O

3	O
weeks	O
on	O
10	O
mg	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
called	O
my	O

to	O
discontinue.	O
I	O
have	O

a	O
workout	O

6	O

a	O

doing	O

After	O

I	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
tired	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
bed	O
at	O
8pm	O
(I'm	O
normally	O
a	O
night-owl).	O
I	O
was	O
mostly	O
feeling	O
drained	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
tired	I-ADR
which	O
was	O
unusual	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
didn't	O
feel	O
that	O
way	O
previous	O
to	O
taking	O
the	O
drug.	O
I	O
have	O
also	O
experienced	O
tingling	B-ADR
or	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
my	O

being	I-ADR
asleep	I-ADR
(example:	O
if	O
you	O
lay	O

it	O

I	O
have	O

off	O

have	O

Don't	O

if	O
it	O
worked	O

since	O
I	O
wasn't	O
on	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
6	O

I	O

try	O
to	O
lower	O
it	O
naturally	O
through	O
exercise	O

instead	O
of	O
the	O

not	O

it's	O

Stay	O

I	O
elected	O
to	O
discontinue	O
immediately	O
with	O
onset	O
of	O
side	O
effects.	O
Will	O
consider	O
other	O
alternatives.	O

Absolutely	O
none!.	O
I	O
was	O
originally	O
taking	O
150mg	O
per	O
day,	O
but	O
cut	O
it	O
to	O
100mg	O
because	O
the	O
lesser	O
dose	O
seemed	O
to	O
work	O
as	O
well.	O
My	O
internist	O
had	O
urged	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
Vioxx,	O
Celebrx	B-Drug
and	O
Bextra	B-Drug
(at	O
different	O
times,	O
of	O
course),	O
but	O
the	O
relief	O
I	O
experienced	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
dramatic	O
as	O
the	O
Cataflam.	O
My	O
orthopaedic	O
surgeon	O
prescribes	O
the	O
Cataflam.	O
It	O
has	O
a	O
slight	B-ADR
effect	I-ADR
on	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
blood	I-ADR
pressure,	O
but,	O
since	O
my	O
pressure	O
is	O
usually	O
low,	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
considered	O
a	O
health	O
risk.	O

Back	B-ADR
pain,	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
seems	O
to	O
be	O
involved.	O
In	O
November	O
of	O
2005	O
I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
elevated	B-Finding
cholesterol.	O
Not	O
really	O
high,	O
but	O
high	O
enough,	O
dosage	O
was	O
only	O
20	O
mg	O
per	O
day.	O
Within	O
two	O
months,	O
I	O
had	O
developed	O
wicked	B-ADR
back	I-ADR
pain,	O
along	O
with	O
neuropathy	B-ADR
and	O
hypersensitivity	B-ADR
that	I-ADR
wrapped	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
abdomen.	O
We	O
suspected	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
involved,	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
it,	O
since	O
my	O
numbers	O
had	O
gotten	O
really	O
low.	O
I	O
was	O
effectively	O
laid	O
up	O
for	O
about	O
six	O
months.	O
Since	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
immediate	O
improvement,	O
we	O
surmised	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
wasn't	O
causing	O
this.	O
It's	O
October	O
2006	O
now,	O
and	O
I'm	O
starting	O
to	O
feel	O
more	O
like	O
myself,	O
still	O
hurts	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
work	O
around	O
it.	O
The	O
cholesterol	O
has	O
crept	O
up,	O
so	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
we	O
started	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
again,	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
I	O
was	O
paractically	O
flat	O
on	O
my	O
back	O
again!	O
So,	O
I've	O
stopped	O
again.	O
It's	O
a	O
bloody	O
shame	O
this	O
is	O
happening,	O
as	O
the	O
drug	O
was	O
extremely	O
effective	O
in	O
dropping	O
that	O
cholesterol.	O
Too	O
bad,	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
something	O
else,	O
I	O
guess.	O

No	O
noticeable	O
side	O
effects.	O
Lowered	O
cholesterol	O
and	O
triglycerides	O
.	O

Lower	B-ADR
gut	I-ADR
pain,	O
diahrrea.	O
This	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
NSAID	O
I've	O
ever	O
taken	O
that	O
gave	O
me	O
discernable	O
relief	O
within	O
90	O
minutes	O
of	O
taking	O
it.	O
Gastrointestinal	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
were	O
due	O
largely	O
to	O
my	O
taking	O
the	O
drug	O
too	O
close	O
together,	O
or	O
after	O
having	O
consumed	O
large	O
amounts	O
of	O
alcohol.	O

After	O
a	O
routine	O
check	O
up	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-Finding
level	I-Finding
was	I-Finding
found	I-Finding
to	I-Finding
be	I-Finding
sky	I-Finding
high.	O
So	O
two	O
months	O
ago	O
the	O
internist	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
high	B-Finding
cholesterol.	O
The	O
lipitor	B-Drug
helped	O
in	O
reducing	O
the	O
cholesterol	O
level	O
by	O
20%.	O
The	O
side	O
effects	O
were	O
terrible!	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
years	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
hipjoints.	O
The	O
lipitor	B-Drug
increased	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
tenfold.	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
walk,	O
sit	O
or	O
drive	O
the	O
car.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
I	I-ADR
was	I-ADR
experiencing	I-ADR
especially	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
hipjoints	I-ADR
was	O
incredible.	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
specialist	O
about	O
these	O
side-effects	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
dose	O
from	O
1	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
1	O
every	O
two	O
days!?	O
I	O
had	O
already	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
had	O
decreased	O
somewhat.	O
I	O
learned	O
from	O
the	O
pharmacist	O
that	O
this	O
drug	O
can	O
cause	O
wasting	B-Finding
of	I-Finding
muscles	I-Finding
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O
end	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
wheelchair	O
because	O
of	O
it!!	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O

I	O
am	O

the	O

from	O

It	O

chronic	B-Symptom

but	O
over	O

causes	O
intestinal	B-ADR

I	O
had	O
symptoms	O
similar	O
to	O
diverticulitis:	O
blood	B-ADR

I	O
would	O
be	O
cautious	O
about	O

attention	O
to	O
cramping,	O
intestinal/stomach	B-ADR

which	O
can	O

Was	O
warned	O
about	O

think	O

underestimated	O
how	O

it	O
would	O
get.	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
ease	O
my	O
pain	B-Symptom
not	O

Have	O

eased	O
and	O

Have	O

to	O

to	O

as	O

I	O
added	O
a	O
rating	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
ago.	O
At	O
that	O
time,	O
I	O
just	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
after	O
only	O
three	O
weeks	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
major	O
side	O
effects	O
I	O
experienced.	O
Many	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
have	O
lifted	O
however	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
experiencing	O
sore	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
stiff	I-ADR
hips,	I-ADR
knees,	I-ADR
ankles	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
feet.	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
the	O
lower	O
half	O
of	O
my	O
body	O
belongs	O
to	O
a	O
much	O
older	O
person	O
than	O
me,	O
I'm	O
only	O
48	O
years	O
old	O
but	O
feel	O
90.	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
concerned	O
that	O
I	O
may	O
have	O
permanent	O
damage	O
done	O
to	O
my	O
legs	O
because	O
of	O
only	O
three	O
weeks	O
on	O
this	O
drug.	O
Is	O
anyone	O
else	O
experiencing	O
this	O
lasting	O
effect	O
from	O
Lipitor?.	O

After	O
taking	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
times	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
very	B-ADR
intense	I-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
burning	I-ADR
from	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
middle	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
back	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
ribs	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
center	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
chest.	O
It	O
would	O
last	O
from	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
to	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
hours	O
and	O
then	O
fade	O
away	O
for	O
awhile.	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
intense	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
intense	I-ADR
burning	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms,	I-ADR
neck	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
sometimes	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
and	O
tried	O
it	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
results.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
but	O
it	O
took	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
month	O
for	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
to	O
stop	O
completely.	O
My	O
doctor	O
had	O
me	O
try	O
2	O
or	O
3	O
other	O
similar	O
medications	O
before	O
this	O
one	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
results.	O
When	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
getting	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
occasionally	O
a	O
couple	O
weeks	O
after	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
was	O
crazy.	O
I'm	O
now	O
afraid	O
to	O
take	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
Cholesterol	O
drugs.	O
Every	O
one	O
that	O
I've	O
tried	O
has	O
had	O
some	O
really	O
bad	O
side	O
effects.	O

hair	B-ADR
fell	I-ADR
out,	O
insomnia,	O
areas	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
fat	I-ADR
under	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
skin	I-ADR
became	I-ADR
sore	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
touch,	O
last	B-ADR
straw	I-ADR
was	I-ADR
ringing	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
ears.	O
I	O
took	O
10mg	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
daily	O
for	O
about	O
5	O
months.	O
It	O
did	O
a	O
fantastic	O
job	O
of	O
lowering	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
and	O
improving	O
the	O
good/bad	O
ratio.	O
Eventually,	O
the	O
insomnia,	O
and	O
the	O
ringing	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
ears	I-ADR
(tinnitus)	I-ADR
caused	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O
it.	O
After	O
2	O
months	O
on	O
nothing	O
I	O
tried	O
5mg	O
of	O
Crestor	B-Drug
(one	O
dose),	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
bed	O
with	O
a	O
heating	O
pad	O
on	O
my	O
legs	O
for	O
the	O
aching	B-ADR
it	I-ADR
caused	I-ADR
(like	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
flu).	O
I	O
know	O
many	O
people	O
who	O
tolerate	O
statin	O
drugs	O
without	O
a	O
problem,	O
but	O
for	O
me,	O
it's	O
just	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
side	O
effects.	O
I	O
won't	O
try	O
again.	O

I	O
took	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
8	O
years,	O
starting	O
at	O
age	O
25,	O
with	O
no	O
side	O
effects	O
(at	O
least,	O
nothing	O
I	O
attributed	O
to	O
the	O
Lipitor).	O
Went	O
off	O
on	O
a	O
couple	O
occasions	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
baby	O
then	O
right	O
back	O
on.	O
After	O
8	O
years,	O
suddenly	O
started	O
having	O
severe	O
weaknesses	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs,	O
specifically	O
thigh	O
muscles	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
trying	O
to	O
run	O
marathons	O
with	O
no	O
exertion.	O
Went	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
pain	B-ADR
went	O
away.	O
Now	O
I'm	O
on	O
Crestor	B-Drug
and	O
just	O
started	O
having	O
even	O
worse	O
side	O
effects	O
:o(.	O
This	O
medication	O
DID	O
help	O

my	O

I	O
was	O
close	O
to	O

when	O
I	O
started	O
it	O
(and	O
I	O
did	O
eat	O
healthy	O
and	O
exercise	O
moderately	O
at	O
the	O

it's	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
40	O
mg.	O
to	O
get	O
my	O

down	O
around	O

My	O

to	O
your	O

everyone's	O

some	O

My	O

tried	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
he	O
couldn't	O

it,	O
it	O
made	O
him	O
fall	B-ADR

taking	O
it	O
for	O
4	O
/5	O
years.	O
Finally	O
I	O
stopped	O
3	O
days	O

due	O
to	O
a	O
high	O
muscle	O
enzyme	O
and	O
now	O
after	O

Have	O
ankle	B-ADR

very	B-ADR

I	O
am	O
not	O
ever	O
going	O

This	O

worked	O
wonders	O
for	O
me.	O
Am	O
only	O
gratefull	O
to	O
the	O
pharmaceutical	O
company	O
that	O

My	O

you	O
are	O
at	O
higher	O
risk	O
for	O

so	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
defininitely	O
lowers	O
the	O
risk.	O
No	O
side	O

Expensive	O
medicine	O

luckily	O
my	O

it.	O

Not	O

I	O
was	O

but	O
then	O
big-pharma	O
got	O
in	O

and	O
made	O
that	O
illegal.	O
Don't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
is	O
still	O
the	O
case.	O
My	O
doctor	O
said	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
the	O
most	O
tested	O
statin	O

My	O
real	O
concern	O
is	O
heart	B-Disease

which	O
is	O
in	O
my	O

Not	O

how	O

the	O

is	O
between	O
low	O

I	O

told	O
me	O
to	O
opt	O

non-NSAIDs	O
such	O
as	O

next	O
time.	O

Took	O
for	O
30	O
days.	O
Was	O
aware	O
of	O
side	O
effects,	O
but	O
DOC	O
assured	O
me	O
they	O
were	O
minimal.	O
I	O
started	O
getting	O
some	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
ankles	I-ADR
from	O
time	O
to	O
time,	O
I	O
work	O
out	O
so	O
attributed	O
the	O

to	O
"old	O

(45).	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
Baltimore	O
on	O

I	O

the	O

a	O

A	O
week	O
later	O
the	O

came	O
back,	O
my	O
ankle	B-ADR
hurt	I-ADR
so	O
much	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
make	O
to	O

I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
walk	I-ADR
up	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

in	O
my	O

without	O
extreme	B-ADR

I	O

&	O
made	O
an	O

it	O
might	O
be	O

this	O

I	O
quit	O
taking	O
the	O

before	O
my	O

"we	O

I	O

those	O
who	O

this	O

the	O

for	O
those	O

us	O
who	O

this	O
can	O
be	O
deviating.	O
It	O
took	O
me	O
3-4	O
weeks	O
to	O
fully	O
recover.	O
MD's	O
need	O

I	O

lowers	O

after	O

it's	O
just	O
a	O
good	O
drug	O
for	O

Better	O
than	O

my	O

Lipitor	B-Drug

for	O

the	O

After	O

for	O
3-4	O
months	O
I	O
had	O
terrible	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
in	I-ADR

Couldn't	B-ADR
walk	I-ADR

even	I-ADR

I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
gout,	O
which	O
runs	O
in	O
my	O

HMO	O

said	O
not	O
gout,	O

didn't	O
know	O
what.	O
I	O
finally	O
stumbled	O
on	O
this	O

and	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
immediately	O
got	O
some	O
relief.	O
That	O
was	O
a	O
month	O
and	O
a	O
half	O

Still	O
have	O
some	O

(eg.	I-ADR

in	I-ADR

but	O
it	O
is	O
gradually	O
getting	O
less.	O
This	O
drug	O
is	O
too	O
dangerous	O
to	O
use.	O
We	O
need	O
something	O
with	O
the	O

not	O
the	O

now.	O
Thanks	O
to	O
all	O
of	O
you	O
for	O
sharing.	O

I	O
recommend	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
it	O
has	O
worked	O
well	O
for	O
me	O
for	O
over	O
15	O
years.	O

Initially	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
side	O
effects.	O
It	O
took	O
the	O
better	O
part	O
of	O
two	O
years	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
start	O
appearing.	O
During	O
that	O
time,	O
my	O
numbers	O
were	O
doing	O
great!	O
But	O
then,	O
very	O
gradually,	O
things	O
began	O
to	O
change.	O
Fatigue	B-ADR
was	O
the	O
first	O
symptom	O
for	O
me.	O
It	O
hit	O
hard!	O
I	O
was	O
retireing	O
at	O
9PM	O
when	O
it	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
11:30.	O
Then	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
joint	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
kicked	O
in.	O
I	O
felt	B-ADR
much	I-ADR
older	I-ADR
than	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
was.	O
My	O
family	O
noticed	O
the	O
short	B-ADR
term	I-ADR
memory	I-ADR
loss	I-ADR
before	O
I	O
did.	O
It	O
was	O
very	O
embarrasing	O
for	O
me.	O
The	O
blisterey	B-ADR
rash	I-ADR
on	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
had	O
me	O
concerned	O
even	O
more.	O
What	O
was	O
wrong	O
with	O
me?	O
Is	O
this	O
what	O
old	O
age(62)	O
should	O
normally	O
bring?	O
When	O
my	O
vision	B-ADR
became	I-ADR
blurry,	O
I	O
started	O
my	O
search.	O
That	O
was	O
in	O
June	O
of	O
2007.	O
By	O
August	O
07,	O
I	O
was	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
good.	O
My	O
cardiologist	O
tried	O
various	O
substitutes	O
without	O
luck	O
until	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
Simivastatin	B-Drug
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
work	O
without	O
the	O
side	O
effects.	O

I	O
can	O
hardly	O
believe	O
that	O
a	O
topically	O
applied	O
gel	O
is	O
causing	O
this	O
stuff,	O
but	O
it	O
gets	O
better	O
when	O
I	O
quit	O
using	O
it	O
and	O
returns	O
when	O
I	O
do	O
use	O
it.	O
hard	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
breathe,	O
lungs	B-ADR
feel	I-ADR
heavy,	O
general	O
feeling	O
of	O
sadness,	O
tiredness,	O
wanting	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
quit	I-ADR
everything	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
give	I-ADR
up	I-ADR
(SOOOOOO	O
not	O
my	O
personality).	O
I	O
was	O
blaming	O
my	O
antibiotic	B-Drug
for	O
these	O
side	O
effects,	O
but	O
now	O
I	O
see	O
that	O
they	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
with	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
solaraze.	O
Scary.	O
LEt	O
me	O
be	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
extremely	O
porous	O
skin,	O
so	O
I	O
am	O
probably	O
absorbing	O
a	O
higher	O
dose	O
than	O
was	O
thought	O
likely,	O
I	O
have	O
eczema	B-Disease
and	O
take	O
other	O
meds	O
that	O
exfoliate	O
my	O
skin,	O
so	O
probably	O
a	O
whopping	O
dose	O
is	O
going	O
in.	O
I	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
use	O
a	O
q-tip	O
and	O
just	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
few	O
spots	O
and	O
then	O
do	O
not	O
get	O
the	O
global	O
bad	O
effect,	O
so	O
I	O
may	O
do	O
it	O
this	O
way	O
and	O
just	O
treat	O
one	O
arm	O
at	O
a	O
time,	O
then	O
one	O
leg.	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
the	O
only	O
prescription	O
drug	O
I	O
take	O
and	O
have	O
taken	O
it	O
for	O
four	O
years	O
now.	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
I	O
am	O
gaining	B-ADR
excess	I-ADR
weight	I-ADR
even	O
though	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
eating	O
more.	O
My	O
stomach	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
bloated,	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
excess	I-ADR
gas	I-ADR
(although	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
weight	O
gain?).	O
I	O
also	O
am	O
experiencing	O
increased	B-ADR
memory	I-ADR
loss,	O
and	O
fatigue,	O
but	O
then	O
I	O
rarely	B-Finding
sleep	I-Finding
well	I-Finding
(due	O
to	O
night	B-Finding
sweats)	O
since	O
I	O
went	O
through	O
menopause	B-Finding
ten	O
years	O
ago.	O
I	O
think	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
symptoms	O
are	O
related	O
to	O
being	O
post	O
menopausal	B-Finding
rather	O
than	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
had	O
the	O
same	O
side	O
effects	O
as	O
Zocor	B-Drug
and	O
confirmed	O
that	O
Zocor	B-Drug
caused	O
myalgia,	O
neuralgia,	O
insomnia,	O
dementia,	O
polyneuropathy,	O
rhabdomyolisis,	O
subdural	B-Finding
hematoma,	O
coma,	O
and	O
pain,	O
pain	B-Finding
pain.	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
seems	O
to	O
cause	O
even	O
more	O
nerve	B-Finding
damage	I-Finding
than	O
Zocor.	O
Before	O
they	O
go	O
to	O
Hell,	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
Pfizer	O
and	O
the	O
doctors	O
who	O
shill	O
for	O
them	O
should	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
nasty	O
prison.	O
Pfizer	O
and	O
its	O
doctor	O
salesmen	O
should	O
be	O
stripped	O
of	O
every	O
asset	O
including	O
their	O
medical	O
licenses.	O
They	O
should	O
be	O
totally	O
destroyed.	O
The	O
proceeds	O
of	O
their	O
financial	O
liquidation	O
should	O
be	O
distributed	O
to	O
their	O
victims.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
tendonitis	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
knees	I-ADR
and	O
troublesome	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
lower	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
feet.	O
My	O
knee	B-ADR
swells	I-ADR
with	O
fluid,	O
so	O
that	O
any	O
movement	O
causes	O
excrutiating	B-ADR
pain.	O
At	O
first,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
might	O
be	O
gout,	O
because	O
it	O
runs	O
in	O
my	O
family,	O
and	O
my	O
toes	B-Finding
swell	I-Finding
up	I-Finding
occasionally.	O
But,	O
after	O
my	O
doctor	O
confirmed	O
that	O
my	O
swollen	B-ADR
knees	I-ADR
were	O
not	O
gout,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
other	O
causes.	O
It	O
dawned	O
on	O
me	O
to	O
check	O
the	O
internet	O
concerning	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking.	O
Sure	O
enough,	O
many	O
people	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
troubles.	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
walk	O
for	O
endless	O
miles.	O
For	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
this	O
drug,	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
hobbling	B-ADR
around,	O
cautious	O
of	O
every	O
painful	O
step.	O
Although	O
it	O
may	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
tomorrow,	O
I	O
will	O
stop	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O

I	O
am	O
amazed	O
to	O
find	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
have	O
experienced	O
hip/knee/ankle	B-ADR
pain,	O
and	O
back	B-ADR
pain,	O
after	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	O
It	O
never	O
occured	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
began	O
around	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
36.	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
feel	O
40	O
years	O
older	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
I	O
experienced.	O
Stopped	O
taking	O
2	O
days	O
ago,	O
hopefully	O
will	O
see	O
improvement.	O

Doc	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
10	O
mg/day.	O
Some	O
stomach	B-ADR
discomfort	I-ADR
initially,	O
but	O
I	O
seemed	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
few	O
weeks.	O
Some	O
muscle	B-ADR
aches	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
pains	I-ADR
which	O
I	O
didn't	O
have	O
before	O
now	O
seem	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
go.	O
Wife	O
says	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
a	B-ADR
lot	I-ADR
grouchier	I-ADR
since	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it.	O
And	O
just	O
yesterday,	O
was	O
out	O
doing	O
the	O
yard	O
spring	O
clean-up,	O
and	O
noticed	O
extreme	B-ADR
fatigue	I-ADR
and	O
shortness	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
breath.	O
Very	O
worrisome.	O
I	O
have	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	O
and	O
will	O
check	O
back	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O
asap.	O
I	O
just	O
recently	O
had	O
my	O
3	O
month	O
cholesterol	O
check-up,	O
and	O
the	O
doctor	O
was	O
very	O
pleased	O
since	O
my	O
overall	O
cholesterol	O
count	O
dropped	O
to	O
3.7	O
from	O
over	O
7.	O
I	O
also	O
take	O
Atacand	B-Drug
for	O
high	B-Finding
blood	I-Finding
pressure	I-Finding
-	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
that	O
one	O
for	O
years.	O
He	O
doesn't	O
know	O
yet	O
about	O
the	O
fatigue	B-ADR
and	O
shortness	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
breath	I-ADR
attacks,	O
because	O
that	O
just	O
happened.	O

My	O
EKG	O
was	O
not	O
good	O
and	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
also	O
indicated	O
a	O
problem.	O
I	O
was	O
sent	O
for	O
a	O
stress	O
test	O
which	O
I	O
failed,	O
and	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
a	O
heart	O
doctor.	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
symptoms	O
of	O
heart	O
problems,	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
high	B-Finding
blood	I-Finding
pressure	I-Finding
and	O
overweight.	O
So	O
lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
prescribed	O
to	O
lessen	O
likelihood	O
of	O
partial	B-Disease
blockage	I-Disease
to	I-Disease
my	I-Disease
heart.	O
Cholesterol	O
levels	O
are	O
terrific	O
now	O
and	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
sent	O
for	O
another	O
stress	O
test	O
next	O
month.	O
I	O
feel	O
great	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
but	O
could	O
not	O
take	O
Zocor(side	O
effects).	O

I	O
took	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
6	O
weeks	O
and	O
noticed	O
extreme	B-ADR
dehydration	I-ADR
and	O
extremely	B-ADR
dry	I-ADR
eyes.	O
My	O
eyes	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
dry	I-ADR
that	I-ADR
they	I-ADR
stick	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
eyelids	I-ADR
at	I-ADR
night	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
am	I-ADR
getting	I-ADR
microabrasions	O
on	O
them	O
-	O
very	O
painful.	O
Additionally,	O
despite	O
eating	O
a	O
pure	O
fiber	O
diet	O
to	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
the	O
medicine	O
has	O
made	O
me	O
extremely	O
constipated.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
off	O
now	O
for	O
5	O
days.	O
The	O

It	O
was	O

I	O
immediately	O
went	O
back	O

this	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

I	O
discovered	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
by	O
taking	O
it.	O

Took	O
three	O
pills	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
and	O
it	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
the	O

twice.	O
Once	O
for	O
elevated	B-ADR
bloodb	I-ADR
pressure	I-ADR
and	O
dizziness.	O
other	O
for	O
severe	O
gastritis.	O
Do	O
not	O
take	O
this	O
pill	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
stomach	O
or	O
blood	O
pressure	O
problems.	O
Scary	O
pill!.	O

I	O
am	O
menstruating	B-ADR
with	I-ADR
heavy	I-ADR
bleeding	I-ADR
every	I-ADR
11	I-ADR
days.	O
Honestly,	O
I	O
can't	O
figure	O
out	O
how	O
I	O
can	O
lose	O
this	O
much	O
blood	O
and	O
still	O
function.	O
I	O
have	O
horrific	B-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
to	O
begin	O
with,	O
so	O
I	O
can't	O
say	O
whether	O
arthrotec	B-Drug
increased	O
that.	O
I	O
have	O
endometriosis,	O
so	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
doesn't	O
agree	O
with	O
arthrotec.	O
It	O
did	O
help	O
with	O
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
I	O
experience	O
with	O
the	O
pinched	O
nerve,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
worth	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
continue.	O

It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
but	O
I	O
became	O
so	O
depressed	B-ADR
that	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
told	O
her	O
I	O
refused	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
anymore.	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
effect	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
caused	O
by	O
an	O
interaction	O
with	O
the	O
birth	B-Drug
control	I-Drug
pill.	O
it	O
lowered	O
my	O
numbers,	O
but	O
made	O
my	O

miserable.	O

Had	O
no	O

always	O

Would	O
give	O
it	O
a	O

it	O

the	O

for	O
me.	O
Triglycerides	O

on	O

worked	O
OK,	O
but	O
had	O

a	O

put	O
me	O
on	O
Lipitor.	O
While	O
it	O
did	O

over	O
24	O

my	O

and	O
Gemfibrozil,	O
as	O
well.	O
This	O
went	O
on	O
much	O
too	O
long,	O
mostly	O
due	O
to	O
my	O
inability	O
to	O
make	O

due	O
to	O

I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
severe	O
leg	B-ADR

at	O
night	O
with	O
the	O

traveling	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

as	O
well.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bed	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
crawl	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
take	O
Advil.	O
I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
what	O
could	O
have	O
caused	O
this	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
Recently	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
that	O
stretched	O
to	O
my	O
side	O
and	O
back.	O
The	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
came	O
suddenly	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
before	O
it	O
became	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
sleep.	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
gotten	O
over	O
a	O
urinery	B-ADR
tract	I-ADR
infection	I-ADR
(one	O
of	O
the	O
side-effects)	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
had	O
returned	O
but	O
the	O
symptoms	O
were	O
different.	O
I	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
urge	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
urinate	I-ADR
constantly	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
no	O
symptoms	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
return	O
again.	O
I	O
remembered	O
reading	O
the	O
phamplet	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O
prescription	O
drugs	O
and	O
it	O
mentioning	O
some	O
of	O
symptoms	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
more	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
or	O
urgency.	O
I	O
also	O
had	O
been	O
experiencing	O
lack	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
energy	I-ADR
for	O
quite	O
some	O
time	O
and	O
I	O
attributed	O
this	O
to	O
stress	B-Finding
but	O
after	O
reading	O
this	O
website	O
I	O
feel	O
it	O
was	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
also.	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
I	O
will	O
take	O
this	O
drug	O
anymore	O
and	O
since	O
I	O
read	O
that	O
taking	O
vitamin	B-Drug
C	I-Drug
can	O
help	O
you	O
with	O
your	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
will	O
try	O
this	O
method	O
instead.	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
alternative	O
to	O
lowering	O

than	O
such	O
a	O
potent	O

that	O
can	O
cause	O

many	O

I	O
don't	O

(I'm	O

and	O

is	O
skeptical	O
that	O

is	O
the	O
culprit.	O
I	O
have	O
also	O
noticed	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
short	B-ADR

and	O
am	O
easily	B-ADR

I'm	O
stopping	O
the	O

today	O
and	O

My	O
GP	O
and	O
a	O

were	O
totally	O
unable	O
to	O
diagnose	O
the	O
problem.	O
I	O
tried	O
stopping	O
each	O

I	O
was	O
taking,	O
some	O
allergy/asthma	O
stuff	O
and	O
Lipitor.	O
All	O
the	O
symptoms	O
largely	O
disappeared	O
after	O
two	O
days	O
off	O
Lipitor.	O
Took	O
months	O
for	O
lingering	O
effects	O
to	O
clear	O
completely.	O
Anyone	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
showing	O
any	O
undiagnosed	O
symptoms,	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
awhile	O
as	O
a	O
test.	O

muscle	B-ADR
ache.	O

Doctor	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
prescription	O
for	O
a	O
year's	O
worth	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
for	O
four	O
months	O
and	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
retest	O
before	O
renewing	O
my	O
prescription.	O
In	O
four	O
months,	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
dropped	O
100	O
points,	O
HDL	O
and	O
LDL	O
were	O
in	O
better,	O
though	O
not	O
perfect	O
balance.	O
With	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
at	O
139,	O
I	O
declined	O
to	O
take	O
more	O
Lipitor.	O
Got	O
HDL	O
and	O
LDL	O
into	O
perfect	O
balance	O
within	O
another	O
two	O
months	O
using	O
certain	O
over-the-counter	O
amino	O
acids,	O
tocotrienols,	O
and	O
other	O
nutrients	O
I	O
found	O
online	O
that	O
supposedly	O
do	O
the	O
job.	O
They	O
do!	O
And	O
the	O
nice	O
thing	O
is,	O
if	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
goes	O
up	O
again,	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
very	O
low	O
dose	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
will	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
it.	O
Good	O
stuff!.	O

I	O
am	O
experiencing	O
severe	O
hip	O
joint	B-ADR
pain,	O
thigh	O
pain,	O
severe	O
thigh	O
fatigue	B-ADR
upon	O
minimal	O

is	O
drastically	O
impairing	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
walk	O
anything	O
beyond	O
a	O
relatively	O
short	O
distance.	O
The	O
question	O
is.	O
is	O
lipitor	B-Drug
causing	O
this?	O
I	O
am	O
taking	O
20	O
mg	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
this	O
for	O
6	O
years.	O
This	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
huge	O
problem	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
2.5	O
years.	O
I	O
read	O
this	O
website	O
and	O
feel	O
that	O
lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
causing	O
my	O
pain.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
numberous	O
orthopods,	O
rheumetoligists,	O
neouroligist,	O
and	O
others	O
who	O
cannot	O
find	O
any	O
problems.	O
So,	O
when	O
I	O
read	O
about	O
all	O
these	O
people	O
who	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
figured	O
this	O
out	O
.	O
I	O
have	O
hope.	O
But	O
are	O
they	O
correct	O
in	O
thier	O
assumptions?	O
We	O
are	O
all	O
desperate	O
to	O
find	O
an	O
answer	O
(the	O
cause)	O
and	O
ultimately	O
a	O
cure.	O
But	O
is	O
lipitor	B-Drug
the	O
answer?	O
That	O
is	O
the	O
question	O
(DP	O

I	O

my	O

I've	O
been	O
taking	O

meds	O
for	O
at	O
least	O
10	O
years	O
including	O
Mevacor,	O
Zocor,	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
Zetia.	O
My	O
cholesterol	O
went	O
from	O
398	O
to	O
260	O
on	O
40	O
Lipitor.	O
This	O
year	O
I	O
was	O
given	O
80	O
mgs	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
Zetia	B-Drug
was	O
added	O
as	O
well.	O
Along	O
with	O
the	O
increased	O
dosage,	O
came	O
crippling	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
back,	I-ADR
neck	I-ADR
and	O
then	O
just	O
my	O
left	O
foot,	O
severe	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
neck	I-ADR
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
couldn't	O
hold	O
it	O
up	O
without	O
an	O
effort,	O
increased	O
sinus	B-ADR
pain,	O
high	B-ADR
blood	I-ADR

So	O
to	O
fix	O
all	O
these	O

I	O
was	O

each	O

so	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
great	O

Finally,	O
I	O
realized	O
enough	O
was	O
enough,	O
I	O
called	O
the	O

to	O

she	O
was	O

it's	O

this	O

I	O

He	O
then	O

I	O

Lipitor,	O
5	O
years	O

after	O
a	O

for	O
this	O

such	O
as	O
potassium,	O
magnesium,	O
vitamin	B-Drug
E,	O
etc	O
with	O
no	O
effect,	O
my	O
family	O
doctor	O
suggested	O
that	O
I	O
stop	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
3	O
days,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
it	O
has	O
any	O
effect.	O
The	O
effect	O
was	O
dramatic.	O
The	O
cramps	B-ADR
did	O
not	O
occur	O
during	O
the	O
night	O
after	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
the	O
40	O
mg	O
with	O
my	O
dinner.	O
They	O
also	O
did	O
not	O
occur	O
on	O
the	O
following	O
two	O
nights.	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
restart	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(once	O
a	O
day	O
with	O
the	O
evening	O
meal)	O
for	O
fear	O
that	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
would	O
just	O
as	O
quickly	O
return.	O
Since	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
that	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
night	O
cramps	B-ADR
ceased	O
so	O
quickly	O
is	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
the	O
40	O
mg	O
entirely	O
in	O
the	O
evening,	O
I	O
decided	O

and	O
half	O
in	O
the	O

Although	O
some	O
mild	O
cramping	B-ADR
did	O

it	O
was	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
had	O
know	O
about	O
this	O
a	O

I	O

I	O

if	O
there	O
were	O
any	O

and	O
he	O

no.	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
taking	O

with	O
no	O
problem	O
but	O
insurance	O
company	O
wouldn't	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O
anymore	O
and	O
made	O
me	O
go	O
on	O
lipitor.	O
After	O
about	O
six	O
months	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
docteor	O
write	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
ins.	O
co.	O
saying	O
I	O
couldn't	O
take	O

and	O
they	O
agreed	O
to	O
put	O
me	O
back	O
on	O

But	O
the	O
long	O
term	O
effect	O
of	O
those	O
six	O
months	O
sent	O
me	O
into	O
a	O
psyhcological	B-ADR

that	O
I	O
never	O
recovered	O
from.	O
I	O
went	O

three	O

they	O
finally	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
diagnoses	O
of	O
bipolar	B-Disease
disorder.	O
Cause	O
unknown.	O
This	O
was	O
three	O
years	O

The	O
drug	O
ruined	O
my	O
life,	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
seperated	O
after	O
this	O
all	O
occurred	O
and	O
before	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
an	O
energtic	O

family	O
man	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
wife	O
and	O
two	O
kids.	O
I	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
because	O
the	O
only	O
other	O
medication	O
I	O
take	O
is	O
an	O

I	O
notice	O
a	O

attributed	O
Bell's	B-Disease

to	O

I	O
too	O
had	O
Bell's,	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
my	O
cholesterol	O

and	O
found	O
I	O
got	O
Bell's	B-Disease
before	O
I	O
started	O
on	O

There	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
consistent	O
occurence	O
of	O
muscle	B-Finding

and/or	O

problems	I-Finding
but	O
I	O
wonder	O
how	O
many	O
other	O
problems	O
are	O
not	O
really	O
attributable	O
to	O
lipitor	B-Drug
eg	O
see	O
my	O

Also	O
I	O
get	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
occasional	O
muscle	B-Finding

at	O

since	O
I	O
was	O
a	O

Maybe	O
my	O

However	O
I	O
don't	O
doubt	O
that	O
some	O
unlucky	O

are	O
having	O
bad	O

I	O
just	O
wonder	O
about	O

of	O
the	O
more	O

ones.	O

for	O

and	O

my	O

It	O
really	O

have	O
to	O
wonder	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
doing	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
make	B-ADR
me	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
tired.	O

After	O
about	O
4	O
years	O
of	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
severe	B-ADR
leg	I-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
at	O
night	O
with	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
traveling	O
to	O
my	O
buddocks	O
and	O
stomach	O
as	O
well.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bed	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
crawl	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
to	O
take	O
Advil	B-Drug
for	O
the	O
pain.	O
I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
what	O
could	O
have	O
caused	O
this	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
Recently	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
that	O
stretched	O
to	O
my	O
side	O
and	O
back.	O
The	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
came	O
suddenly	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
before	O
it	O
became	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
sleep.	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
gotten	O
over	O
a	O
urinery	B-Disease
tract	I-Disease
infection	I-Disease
and	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
had	O
returned	O
but	O
the	O
symptoms	O
were	O
different.	O
I	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
urge	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
urinate	I-ADR
constantly	I-ADR
but	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
no	O
symptoms	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
return	O
again.	O
I	O
remembered	O
reading	O
the	O
phamplet	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O
prescription	O
drugs	O
and	O
it	O
mentioning	O
some	O
of	O
symptoms	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
mor.	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
alternative	O
to	O
lowering	O
cholesterol	O
than	O
such	O
a	O
potent	O
drug	O
that	O
can	O
cause	O
so	O
many	O
side	O
effects.	O
I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
case-study	O
when	O
they	O
finally	O
take	O
this	O
drug	O
off	O
the	O
market.	O

two	O
years	O
of	O

many	O
mri's,many	O

for	O

lead	B-ADR
legs.	O
I	O
never	O
stopped	O
searching	O
for	O
an	O
answer	O
and	O
not	O
one	O
doctor	O
picked	O
it	O
up	O
even	O
though	O
that's	O
the	O
first	O
question	O
they	O
ask	O
you.	O
What	O
medicines	O
do	O
you	O
take?	O
Now	O
all	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
push	O
more	O
meds,	O
i	O
am	O
taking	O
neurontin,oxycotin,	O
zanax,	O
and	O
celebrex.	O
BEWARE.	O

I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
lipitor,	O
but	O
shortly	O
after	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it,	O
I	O
exprienced	O
complete	O
paralysis	B-ADR
in	O
my	O
forehead	O
(peripheral	O
neuropathy).	O
Went	O
to	O
a	O
neurologist,GP	O
and	O
ENT,	O
none	O
of	O
whom	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
paralysis	B-ADR
(both	O
sides)	O
with	O
no	O
other	O
symptoms.	O
Has	O
any	O
one	O
else	O
come	O
across	O
this	O
symptom?	O
I	O
m	O
tempted	O
to	O
go	O
off	O
the	O
medicine	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
paralysis	B-ADR
goes	O
away.	O
It	O
really	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholestrol	O
a	O
lot,	O
so	O
I	O
hope	O
this	O
problem	O
isn;t	O
related.	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
reduced	O
my	O
readings	O
to	O
almost	O
normal.	O
At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
suffered	O
from	O

The	O

all	I-ADR
over	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
body	I-ADR
got	O
worse	O
as	O
time	O
went	O
on.	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
left	O
my	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
at	O
home	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
vacation	O
or	O
other	O
trip,	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
feel	O
better.	O
My	O
doctor	O
told	O
me	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
remote	O
possibility	O
that	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
agravating	O
the	O
fibromyalgia.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
feel	O
so	O
much	O
better!	O
But,	O
it	O
seems	O
I	O
buggered	O
up	O
my	O

from	O
all	O
the	O
pain	O
killers	O
that	O
I	O
took.	O
What	O
to	O
