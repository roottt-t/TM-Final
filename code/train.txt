that	O

some	O

you	O

Is	O
it	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
slipped	B-Disease
vertabrae	I-Disease
and	O
a	O
degenerative	B-Disease
disk.	O
This	O
medicine	O
has	O
been	O
extrememly	O
helpful.	O
I	O
don't	O
take	O
it	O
daily,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
sign	O
of	O
a	O
flare	O
and	O
it	O
helps	O
almost	O
immediately.	O
I	O
tried	O
Relafen,	O
vicodine,	O
flexeril	B-Drug
and	O
OTC	O
pain	O
relief	O
and	O
nothing	O
has	O
helped	O
like	O
this.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
this	O
medication	O
for	O
approximately	O
two	O
years	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
affective	O
in	O
lowering	O
my	O
cholesterol;	O
however,	O
I	O
did	O
notice	O
that	O
I	O
became	O
depressed	B-ADR
with	O
intermittent	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain.	O
I	O
recently	O
mentioned	O
this	O
to	O
my	O
physician	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
if	O
this	O
particular	O
medication	O
causes	O
these	O
symptoms	O
as	O
all	O
my	O
blood	O
studies	O
for	O
liver	O
function,	O
etc	O
have	O
been	O
normal.	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
I	O
felt	O
so	O
much	O
better.	O
I	O
will	O
call	O
him	O
tomorrow	O
and	O
ask	O
if	O
I	O
can	O
be	O
switched	O
to	O
another	O
medication.	O
It	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
effective	O
medication,	O
but	O
obviously	O
has	O
its	O
problems	O
as	O
indicated	O
by	O
those	O
patients	O
who	O
had	O
very	O
similar	O
effects.	O

this	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
shot	O
at	O
using	O
a	O
statin	O
to	O
reduce	O
cholesterol	O
ldl.	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
all	O
the	O
statin	O
drugs,	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
very	O
expensive	O
drug	O
of	O
choice	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
doc's	O
out	O
there.	O
For	O
all	O
of	O
you	O
who	O
now	O
have	O
extremely	O
low	O
LDL	O
and	O
a	O
bad	O
case	O
of	O
joint	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
extent	I-ADR
that	I-ADR
it	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
arthritic	I-ADR
or	O
having	O
bad	O
muscle	B-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
that	O
you	O
never	O
got	O
prior	O
to	O
the	O
drug,	O
it	O
is	O
from	O
the	O
statins.	O
The	O
drug	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
decrease	O
LDL	O
through	O
a	O
mechanism	O
which	O
also	O
destroys	O
and	O
depletes	O
your	O
bodies	O
ability	O
to	O
make	O
CoQ10.	O
This	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
they	O
health	O
of	O
muscles	O
and	O
joints	O
(that's	O
why	O
you	O
are	O
experiencing	O
the	O
joint	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
and	O
numbness).	O
Remember	O
your	O
heart	O
is	O
a	O
muscle,	O
guess	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
to	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
depletion	O
of	O
the	O
CoQ10???	O
If	O
you	O
do	O
some	O
research	O
on	O
the	O
internet,	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
statins	O
make	O
no	O
claims/nor	O
have	O
studies	O
shown	O
them	O
to	O
reduce	O
heart	B-Disease
attacks,	O
but	O
they	O
cause	O
muscle	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
i.e.	O
your	O
heart,	O
this	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
put	O
younger	O
and	O
younger	O
people	O
on	O
these	O
drugs	O
and.	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
own	O
research	O
versus	O
just	O
listening	O
to	O
the	O
doctor	O
who	O
wants	O
your	O
LDL	O
down	O
to	O
like	O
below	O
130,	O
neurosurgeons,	O
who	O
have	O
studied	O
this	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
all	O
too	O
low.	O
And	O
just	O
because	O
your	O
test	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
show	O
your	O
liver	O
functions	O
are	O
fine	O
and	O
don't	O
show	O
any	O
broken	O
down	O
muscle	O
toxins	O
in	O
the	O
blood	O
doesn't	O
mean	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
CoQ10	O
isn't	O
breaking	O
down	O
and	O
damaging	B-ADR
your	I-ADR
muscles	I-ADR
very	O
slowly.	O
Mine	O
always	O

I	O

joints	I-ADR
(never	O

and	O
bad	O

(also	O
never	O

those	O
until	O

is	O
you	O

high	O
blood	O
pressure,	O
high	B-Disease
LDL,	O
over	B-Finding
weight	I-Finding
and	O
maybe	O

then	O
you	O
probably	O
need	O
something	O
to	O

the	O

if	O

you	O

of	O
the	O

i	O

this	O

i	O
already	O

how	O

i'm	O

and	O
can	O

my	I-ADR

great!!	O
:|.	O

I	O
used	O
to	O
take	O
Provachol	B-Drug
(sp?)but	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
caused	O
extreme	B-ADR
bloating.	O
It	O
also	O
seem	O
to	O
increase	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
heart	I-ADR
rate	I-ADR
therefore	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
sleep	I-ADR
well.	O
I	O
requested	O
to	O
take	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(10mg).	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
months	O
now.	O
I	O
will	O
go	O
for	O
a	O

within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
so	O
we'll	O
see	O
how	O
good	O
it	O
did	O
its	O
job.	O
As	O
far	O
as	O
side	O
effects	O
are	O
concerned,	O
I	O
find	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
also	O
causes	O
bloating	B-ADR
and	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
gas	B-ADR
build	O
up	O
although	O
not	O
as	O
badly	O
as	O
my	O
previous	O

I'm	O
finding	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
fit	O
into	O
my	O
clothes	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
bloating.	O
I	O
also	O
find	O
that	O
it	O
makes	O
me	O
a	O
bit	O
drowsy,	O
almost	O
like	O
a	O
sleeping	O
pill.	O
I	O
therefore	O
take	O
it	O
at	O
bedtime	O
but	O
my	O
sleep	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
not	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
sound	I-ADR
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
refreshing.	O
I	O
developed	O
a	O
pain	B-ADR
that	I-ADR
seems	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
originate	I-ADR
at	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
neck,	O
travel	O

and	O
then	O
run	O
to	O
my	O

I	O
first	O
attributed	O
this	O
to	O

because	O
I	O
do	O
a	O

I	O

perhaps	O
that	O
I	O

I	O
can	O

that	O
today	O
is	O
the	O
first	O

that	O
I	O

felt	O
really	O

I'll	O

will	O

My	O

After	O

3	O
weeks	O
on	O
10	O
mg	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
called	O
my	O

to	O
discontinue.	O
I	O
have	O

a	O
workout	O

6	O

a	O

doing	O

After	O

I	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
tired	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
bed	O
at	O
8pm	O
(I'm	O
normally	O
a	O
night-owl).	O
I	O
was	O
mostly	O
feeling	O
drained	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
tired	I-ADR
which	O
was	O
unusual	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
didn't	O
feel	O
that	O
way	O
previous	O
to	O
taking	O
the	O
drug.	O
I	O
have	O
also	O
experienced	O
tingling	B-ADR
or	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
my	O

being	I-ADR
asleep	I-ADR
(example:	O
if	O
you	O
lay	O

it	O

I	O
have	O

off	O

have	O

Don't	O

if	O
it	O
worked	O

since	O
I	O
wasn't	O
on	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
6	O

I	O

try	O
to	O
lower	O
it	O
naturally	O
through	O
exercise	O

instead	O
of	O
the	O

not	O

it's	O

Stay	O

I	O
elected	O
to	O
discontinue	O
immediately	O
with	O
onset	O
of	O
side	O
effects.	O
Will	O
consider	O
other	O
alternatives.	O

Absolutely	O
none!.	O
I	O
was	O
originally	O
taking	O
150mg	O
per	O
day,	O
but	O
cut	O
it	O
to	O
100mg	O
because	O
the	O
lesser	O
dose	O
seemed	O
to	O
work	O
as	O
well.	O
My	O
internist	O
had	O
urged	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
Vioxx,	O
Celebrx	B-Drug
and	O
Bextra	B-Drug
(at	O
different	O
times,	O
of	O
course),	O
but	O
the	O
relief	O
I	O
experienced	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
dramatic	O
as	O
the	O
Cataflam.	O
My	O
orthopaedic	O
surgeon	O
prescribes	O
the	O
Cataflam.	O
It	O
has	O
a	O
slight	B-ADR
effect	I-ADR
on	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
blood	I-ADR
pressure,	O
but,	O
since	O
my	O
pressure	O
is	O
usually	O
low,	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
considered	O
a	O
health	O
risk.	O

Back	B-ADR
pain,	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
seems	O
to	O
be	O
involved.	O
In	O
November	O
of	O
2005	O
I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
elevated	B-Finding
cholesterol.	O
Not	O
really	O
high,	O
but	O
high	O
enough,	O
dosage	O
was	O
only	O
20	O
mg	O
per	O
day.	O
Within	O
two	O
months,	O
I	O
had	O
developed	O
wicked	B-ADR
back	I-ADR
pain,	O
along	O
with	O
neuropathy	B-ADR
and	O
hypersensitivity	B-ADR
that	I-ADR
wrapped	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
abdomen.	O
We	O
suspected	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
involved,	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
it,	O
since	O
my	O
numbers	O
had	O
gotten	O
really	O
low.	O
I	O
was	O
effectively	O
laid	O
up	O
for	O
about	O
six	O
months.	O
Since	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
immediate	O
improvement,	O
we	O
surmised	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
wasn't	O
causing	O
this.	O
It's	O
October	O
2006	O
now,	O
and	O
I'm	O
starting	O
to	O
feel	O
more	O
like	O
myself,	O
still	O
hurts	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
work	O
around	O
it.	O
The	O
cholesterol	O
has	O
crept	O
up,	O
so	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
we	O
started	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
again,	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
I	O
was	O
paractically	O
flat	O
on	O
my	O
back	O
again!	O
So,	O
I've	O
stopped	O
again.	O
It's	O
a	O
bloody	O
shame	O
this	O
is	O
happening,	O
as	O
the	O
drug	O
was	O
extremely	O
effective	O
in	O
dropping	O
that	O
cholesterol.	O
Too	O
bad,	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
something	O
else,	O
I	O
guess.	O

No	O
noticeable	O
side	O
effects.	O
Lowered	O
cholesterol	O
and	O
triglycerides	O
.	O

Lower	B-ADR
gut	I-ADR
pain,	O
diahrrea.	O
This	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
NSAID	O
I've	O
ever	O
taken	O
that	O
gave	O
me	O
discernable	O
relief	O
within	O
90	O
minutes	O
of	O
taking	O
it.	O
Gastrointestinal	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
were	O
due	O
largely	O
to	O
my	O
taking	O
the	O
drug	O
too	O
close	O
together,	O
or	O
after	O
having	O
consumed	O
large	O
amounts	O
of	O
alcohol.	O

After	O
a	O
routine	O
check	O
up	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-Finding
level	I-Finding
was	I-Finding
found	I-Finding
to	I-Finding
be	I-Finding
sky	I-Finding
high.	O
So	O
two	O
months	O
ago	O
the	O
internist	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
high	B-Finding
cholesterol.	O
The	O
lipitor	B-Drug
helped	O
in	O
reducing	O
the	O
cholesterol	O
level	O
by	O
20%.	O
The	O
side	O
effects	O
were	O
terrible!	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
years	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
hipjoints.	O
The	O
lipitor	B-Drug
increased	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
tenfold.	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
walk,	O
sit	O
or	O
drive	O
the	O
car.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
I	I-ADR
was	I-ADR
experiencing	I-ADR
especially	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
hipjoints	I-ADR
was	O
incredible.	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
specialist	O
about	O
these	O
side-effects	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
dose	O
from	O
1	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
1	O
every	O
two	O
days!?	O
I	O
had	O
already	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
had	O
decreased	O
somewhat.	O
I	O
learned	O
from	O
the	O
pharmacist	O
that	O
this	O
drug	O
can	O
cause	O
wasting	B-Finding
of	I-Finding
muscles	I-Finding
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O
end	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
wheelchair	O
because	O
of	O
it!!	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O

I	O
am	O

the	O

from	O

It	O

chronic	B-Symptom

but	O
over	O

causes	O
intestinal	B-ADR

I	O
had	O
symptoms	O
similar	O
to	O
diverticulitis:	O
blood	B-ADR

I	O
would	O
be	O
cautious	O
about	O

attention	O
to	O
cramping,	O
intestinal/stomach	B-ADR

which	O
can	O

Was	O
warned	O
about	O

think	O

underestimated	O
how	O

it	O
would	O
get.	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
ease	O
my	O
pain	B-Symptom
not	O

Have	O

eased	O
and	O

Have	O

to	O

to	O

as	O

I	O
added	O
a	O
rating	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
ago.	O
At	O
that	O
time,	O
I	O
just	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
after	O
only	O
three	O
weeks	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
major	O
side	O
effects	O
I	O
experienced.	O
Many	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
have	O
lifted	O
however	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
experiencing	O
sore	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
stiff	I-ADR
hips,	I-ADR
knees,	I-ADR
ankles	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
feet.	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
the	O
lower	O
half	O
of	O
my	O
body	O
belongs	O
to	O
a	O
much	O
older	O
person	O
than	O
me,	O
I'm	O
only	O
48	O
years	O
old	O
but	O
feel	O
90.	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
concerned	O
that	O
I	O
may	O
have	O
permanent	O
damage	O
done	O
to	O
my	O
legs	O
because	O
of	O
only	O
three	O
weeks	O
on	O
this	O
drug.	O
Is	O
anyone	O
else	O
experiencing	O
this	O
lasting	O
effect	O
from	O
Lipitor?.	O

After	O
taking	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
times	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
very	B-ADR
intense	I-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
burning	I-ADR
from	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
middle	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
back	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
ribs	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
center	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
chest.	O
It	O
would	O
last	O
from	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
to	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
hours	O
and	O
then	O
fade	O
away	O
for	O
awhile.	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
intense	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
intense	I-ADR
burning	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms,	I-ADR
neck	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
sometimes	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
and	O
tried	O
it	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
results.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
but	O
it	O
took	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
month	O
for	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
to	O
stop	O
completely.	O
My	O
doctor	O
had	O
me	O
try	O
2	O
or	O
3	O
other	O
similar	O
medications	O
before	O
this	O
one	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
results.	O
When	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
getting	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
occasionally	O
a	O
couple	O
weeks	O
after	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
was	O
crazy.	O
I'm	O
now	O
afraid	O
to	O
take	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
Cholesterol	O
drugs.	O
Every	O
one	O
that	O
I've	O
tried	O
has	O
had	O
some	O
really	O
bad	O
side	O
effects.	O

hair	B-ADR
fell	I-ADR
out,	O
insomnia,	O
areas	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
fat	I-ADR
under	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
skin	I-ADR
became	I-ADR
sore	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
touch,	O
last	B-ADR
straw	I-ADR
was	I-ADR
ringing	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
ears.	O
I	O
took	O
10mg	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
daily	O
for	O
about	O
5	O
months.	O
It	O
did	O
a	O
fantastic	O
job	O
of	O
lowering	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
and	O
improving	O
the	O
good/bad	O
ratio.	O
Eventually,	O
the	O
insomnia,	O
and	O
the	O
ringing	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
ears	I-ADR
(tinnitus)	I-ADR
caused	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O
it.	O
After	O
2	O
months	O
on	O
nothing	O
I	O
tried	O
5mg	O
of	O
Crestor	B-Drug
(one	O
dose),	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
bed	O
with	O
a	O
heating	O
pad	O
on	O
my	O
legs	O
for	O
the	O
aching	B-ADR
it	I-ADR
caused	I-ADR
(like	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
flu).	O
I	O
know	O
many	O
people	O
who	O
tolerate	O
statin	O
drugs	O
without	O
a	O
problem,	O
but	O
for	O
me,	O
it's	O
just	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
side	O
effects.	O
I	O
won't	O
try	O
again.	O

I	O
took	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
8	O
years,	O
starting	O
at	O
age	O
25,	O
with	O
no	O
side	O
effects	O
(at	O
least,	O
nothing	O
I	O
attributed	O
to	O
the	O
Lipitor).	O
Went	O
off	O
on	O
a	O
couple	O
occasions	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
baby	O
then	O
right	O
back	O
on.	O
After	O
8	O
years,	O
suddenly	O
started	O
having	O
severe	O
weaknesses	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs,	O
specifically	O
thigh	O
muscles	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
trying	O
to	O
run	O
marathons	O
with	O
no	O
exertion.	O
Went	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
pain	B-ADR
went	O
away.	O
Now	O
I'm	O
on	O
Crestor	B-Drug
and	O
just	O
started	O
having	O
even	O
worse	O
side	O
effects	O
:o(.	O
This	O
medication	O
DID	O
help	O

my	O

I	O
was	O
close	O
to	O

when	O
I	O
started	O
it	O
(and	O
I	O
did	O
eat	O
healthy	O
and	O
exercise	O
moderately	O
at	O
the	O

it's	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
40	O
mg.	O
to	O
get	O
my	O

down	O
around	O

My	O

to	O
your	O

everyone's	O

some	O

My	O

tried	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
he	O
couldn't	O

it,	O
it	O
made	O
him	O
fall	B-ADR

taking	O
it	O
for	O
4	O
/5	O
years.	O
Finally	O
I	O
stopped	O
3	O
days	O

due	O
to	O
a	O
high	O
muscle	O
enzyme	O
and	O
now	O
after	O

Have	O
ankle	B-ADR

very	B-ADR

I	O
am	O
not	O
ever	O
going	O

This	O

worked	O
wonders	O
for	O
me.	O
Am	O
only	O
gratefull	O
to	O
the	O
pharmaceutical	O
company	O
that	O

My	O

you	O
are	O
at	O
higher	O
risk	O
for	O

so	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
defininitely	O
lowers	O
the	O
risk.	O
No	O
side	O

Expensive	O
medicine	O

luckily	O
my	O

it.	O

Not	O

I	O
was	O

but	O
then	O
big-pharma	O
got	O
in	O

and	O
made	O
that	O
illegal.	O
Don't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
is	O
still	O
the	O
case.	O
My	O
doctor	O
said	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
the	O
most	O
tested	O
statin	O

My	O
real	O
concern	O
is	O
heart	B-Disease

which	O
is	O
in	O
my	O

Not	O

how	O

the	O

is	O
between	O
low	O

I	O

told	O
me	O
to	O
opt	O

non-NSAIDs	O
such	O
as	O

next	O
time.	O

Took	O
for	O
30	O
days.	O
Was	O
aware	O
of	O
side	O
effects,	O
but	O
DOC	O
assured	O
me	O
they	O
were	O
minimal.	O
I	O
started	O
getting	O
some	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
ankles	I-ADR
from	O
time	O
to	O
time,	O
I	O
work	O
out	O
so	O
attributed	O
the	O

to	O
"old	O

(45).	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
Baltimore	O
on	O

I	O

the	O

a	O

A	O
week	O
later	O
the	O

came	O
back,	O
my	O
ankle	B-ADR
hurt	I-ADR
so	O
much	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
make	O
to	O

I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
walk	I-ADR
up	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

in	O
my	O

without	O
extreme	B-ADR

I	O

&	O
made	O
an	O

it	O
might	O
be	O

this	O

I	O
quit	O
taking	O
the	O

before	O
my	O

"we	O

I	O

those	O
who	O

this	O

the	O

for	O
those	O

us	O
who	O

this	O
can	O
be	O
deviating.	O
It	O
took	O
me	O
3-4	O
weeks	O
to	O
fully	O
recover.	O
MD's	O
need	O

I	O

lowers	O

after	O

it's	O
just	O
a	O
good	O
drug	O
for	O

Better	O
than	O

my	O

Lipitor	B-Drug

for	O

the	O

After	O

for	O
3-4	O
months	O
I	O
had	O
terrible	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
in	I-ADR

Couldn't	B-ADR
walk	I-ADR

even	I-ADR

I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
gout,	O
which	O
runs	O
in	O
my	O

HMO	O

said	O
not	O
gout,	O

didn't	O
know	O
what.	O
I	O
finally	O
stumbled	O
on	O
this	O

and	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
immediately	O
got	O
some	O
relief.	O
That	O
was	O
a	O
month	O
and	O
a	O
half	O

Still	O
have	O
some	O

(eg.	I-ADR

in	I-ADR

but	O
it	O
is	O
gradually	O
getting	O
less.	O
This	O
drug	O
is	O
too	O
dangerous	O
to	O
use.	O
We	O
need	O
something	O
with	O
the	O

not	O
the	O

now.	O
Thanks	O
to	O
all	O
of	O
you	O
for	O
sharing.	O

I	O
recommend	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
it	O
has	O
worked	O
well	O
for	O
me	O
for	O
over	O
15	O
years.	O

Initially	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
side	O
effects.	O
It	O
took	O
the	O
better	O
part	O
of	O
two	O
years	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
start	O
appearing.	O
During	O
that	O
time,	O
my	O
numbers	O
were	O
doing	O
great!	O
But	O
then,	O
very	O
gradually,	O
things	O
began	O
to	O
change.	O
Fatigue	B-ADR
was	O
the	O
first	O
symptom	O
for	O
me.	O
It	O
hit	O
hard!	O
I	O
was	O
retireing	O
at	O
9PM	O
when	O
it	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
11:30.	O
Then	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
joint	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
kicked	O
in.	O
I	O
felt	B-ADR
much	I-ADR
older	I-ADR
than	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
was.	O
My	O
family	O
noticed	O
the	O
short	B-ADR
term	I-ADR
memory	I-ADR
loss	I-ADR
before	O
I	O
did.	O
It	O
was	O
very	O
embarrasing	O
for	O
me.	O
The	O
blisterey	B-ADR
rash	I-ADR
on	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
had	O
me	O
concerned	O
even	O
more.	O
What	O
was	O
wrong	O
with	O
me?	O
Is	O
this	O
what	O
old	O
age(62)	O
should	O
normally	O
bring?	O
When	O
my	O
vision	B-ADR
became	I-ADR
blurry,	O
I	O
started	O
my	O
search.	O
That	O
was	O
in	O
June	O
of	O
2007.	O
By	O
August	O
07,	O
I	O
was	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
good.	O
My	O
cardiologist	O
tried	O
various	O
substitutes	O
without	O
luck	O
until	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
Simivastatin	B-Drug
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
work	O
without	O
the	O
side	O
effects.	O

I	O
can	O
hardly	O
believe	O
that	O
a	O
topically	O
applied	O
gel	O
is	O
causing	O
this	O
stuff,	O
but	O
it	O
gets	O
better	O
when	O
I	O
quit	O
using	O
it	O
and	O
returns	O
when	O
I	O
do	O
use	O
it.	O
hard	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
breathe,	O
lungs	B-ADR
feel	I-ADR
heavy,	O
general	O
feeling	O
of	O
sadness,	O
tiredness,	O
wanting	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
quit	I-ADR
everything	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
give	I-ADR
up	I-ADR
(SOOOOOO	O
not	O
my	O
personality).	O
I	O
was	O
blaming	O
my	O
antibiotic	B-Drug
for	O
these	O
side	O
effects,	O
but	O
now	O
I	O
see	O
that	O
they	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
with	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
solaraze.	O
Scary.	O
LEt	O
me	O
be	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
extremely	O
porous	O
skin,	O
so	O
I	O
am	O
probably	O
absorbing	O
a	O
higher	O
dose	O
than	O
was	O
thought	O
likely,	O
I	O
have	O
eczema	B-Disease
and	O
take	O
other	O
meds	O
that	O
exfoliate	O
my	O
skin,	O
so	O
probably	O
a	O
whopping	O
dose	O
is	O
going	O
in.	O
I	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
use	O
a	O
q-tip	O
and	O
just	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
few	O
spots	O
and	O
then	O
do	O
not	O
get	O
the	O
global	O
bad	O
effect,	O
so	O
I	O
may	O
do	O
it	O
this	O
way	O
and	O
just	O
treat	O
one	O
arm	O
at	O
a	O
time,	O
then	O
one	O
leg.	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
the	O
only	O
prescription	O
drug	O
I	O
take	O
and	O
have	O
taken	O
it	O
for	O
four	O
years	O
now.	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
I	O
am	O
gaining	B-ADR
excess	I-ADR
weight	I-ADR
even	O
though	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
eating	O
more.	O
My	O
stomach	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
bloated,	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
excess	I-ADR
gas	I-ADR
(although	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
weight	O
gain?).	O
I	O
also	O
am	O
experiencing	O
increased	B-ADR
memory	I-ADR
loss,	O
and	O
fatigue,	O
but	O
then	O
I	O
rarely	B-Finding
sleep	I-Finding
well	I-Finding
(due	O
to	O
night	B-Finding
sweats)	O
since	O
I	O
went	O
through	O
menopause	B-Finding
ten	O
years	O
ago.	O
I	O
think	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
symptoms	O
are	O
related	O
to	O
being	O
post	O
menopausal	B-Finding
rather	O
than	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
had	O
the	O
same	O
side	O
effects	O
as	O
Zocor	B-Drug
and	O
confirmed	O
that	O
Zocor	B-Drug
caused	O
myalgia,	O
neuralgia,	O
insomnia,	O
dementia,	O
polyneuropathy,	O
rhabdomyolisis,	O
subdural	B-Finding
hematoma,	O
coma,	O
and	O
pain,	O
pain	B-Finding
pain.	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
seems	O
to	O
cause	O
even	O
more	O
nerve	B-Finding
damage	I-Finding
than	O
Zocor.	O
Before	O
they	O
go	O
to	O
Hell,	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
Pfizer	O
and	O
the	O
doctors	O
who	O
shill	O
for	O
them	O
should	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
nasty	O
prison.	O
Pfizer	O
and	O
its	O
doctor	O
salesmen	O
should	O
be	O
stripped	O
of	O
every	O
asset	O
including	O
their	O
medical	O
licenses.	O
They	O
should	O
be	O
totally	O
destroyed.	O
The	O
proceeds	O
of	O
their	O
financial	O
liquidation	O
should	O
be	O
distributed	O
to	O
their	O
victims.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
tendonitis	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
knees	I-ADR
and	O
troublesome	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
lower	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
feet.	O
My	O
knee	B-ADR
swells	I-ADR
with	O
fluid,	O
so	O
that	O
any	O
movement	O
causes	O
excrutiating	B-ADR
pain.	O
At	O
first,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
might	O
be	O
gout,	O
because	O
it	O
runs	O
in	O
my	O
family,	O
and	O
my	O
toes	B-Finding
swell	I-Finding
up	I-Finding
occasionally.	O
But,	O
after	O
my	O
doctor	O
confirmed	O
that	O
my	O
swollen	B-ADR
knees	I-ADR
were	O
not	O
gout,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
other	O
causes.	O
It	O
dawned	O
on	O
me	O
to	O
check	O
the	O
internet	O
concerning	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking.	O
Sure	O
enough,	O
many	O
people	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
troubles.	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
walk	O
for	O
endless	O
miles.	O
For	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
this	O
drug,	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
hobbling	B-ADR
around,	O
cautious	O
of	O
every	O
painful	O
step.	O
Although	O
it	O
may	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
tomorrow,	O
I	O
will	O
stop	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O

I	O
am	O
amazed	O
to	O
find	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
have	O
experienced	O
hip/knee/ankle	B-ADR
pain,	O
and	O
back	B-ADR
pain,	O
after	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	O
It	O
never	O
occured	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
began	O
around	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
36.	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
feel	O
40	O
years	O
older	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
I	O
experienced.	O
Stopped	O
taking	O
2	O
days	O
ago,	O
hopefully	O
will	O
see	O
improvement.	O

Doc	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
10	O
mg/day.	O
Some	O
stomach	B-ADR
discomfort	I-ADR
initially,	O
but	O
I	O
seemed	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
few	O
weeks.	O
Some	O
muscle	B-ADR
aches	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
pains	I-ADR
which	O
I	O
didn't	O
have	O
before	O
now	O
seem	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
go.	O
Wife	O
says	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
a	B-ADR
lot	I-ADR
grouchier	I-ADR
since	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it.	O
And	O
just	O
yesterday,	O
was	O
out	O
doing	O
the	O
yard	O
spring	O
clean-up,	O
and	O
noticed	O
extreme	B-ADR
fatigue	I-ADR
and	O
shortness	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
breath.	O
Very	O
worrisome.	O
I	O
have	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	O
and	O
will	O
check	O
back	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O
asap.	O
I	O
just	O
recently	O
had	O
my	O
3	O
month	O
cholesterol	O
check-up,	O
and	O
the	O
doctor	O
was	O
very	O
pleased	O
since	O
my	O
overall	O
cholesterol	O
count	O
dropped	O
to	O
3.7	O
from	O
over	O
7.	O
I	O
also	O
take	O
Atacand	B-Drug
for	O
high	B-Finding
blood	I-Finding
pressure	I-Finding
-	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
that	O
one	O
for	O
years.	O
He	O
doesn't	O
know	O
yet	O
about	O
the	O
fatigue	B-ADR
and	O
shortness	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
breath	I-ADR
attacks,	O
because	O
that	O
just	O
happened.	O

My	O
EKG	O
was	O
not	O
good	O
and	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
also	O
indicated	O
a	O
problem.	O
I	O
was	O
sent	O
for	O
a	O
stress	O
test	O
which	O
I	O
failed,	O
and	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
a	O
heart	O
doctor.	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
symptoms	O
of	O
heart	O
problems,	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
high	B-Finding
blood	I-Finding
pressure	I-Finding
and	O
overweight.	O
So	O
lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
prescribed	O
to	O
lessen	O
likelihood	O
of	O
partial	B-Disease
blockage	I-Disease
to	I-Disease
my	I-Disease
heart.	O
Cholesterol	O
levels	O
are	O
terrific	O
now	O
and	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
sent	O
for	O
another	O
stress	O
test	O
next	O
month.	O
I	O
feel	O
great	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
but	O
could	O
not	O
take	O
Zocor(side	O
effects).	O

I	O
took	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
6	O
weeks	O
and	O
noticed	O
extreme	B-ADR
dehydration	I-ADR
and	O
extremely	B-ADR
dry	I-ADR
eyes.	O
My	O
eyes	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
dry	I-ADR
that	I-ADR
they	I-ADR
stick	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
eyelids	I-ADR
at	I-ADR
night	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
am	I-ADR
getting	I-ADR
microabrasions	O
on	O
them	O
-	O
very	O
painful.	O
Additionally,	O
despite	O
eating	O
a	O
pure	O
fiber	O
diet	O
to	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
the	O
medicine	O
has	O
made	O
me	O
extremely	O
constipated.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
off	O
now	O
for	O
5	O
days.	O
The	O

It	O
was	O

I	O
immediately	O
went	O
back	O

this	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

I	O
discovered	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
by	O
taking	O
it.	O

Took	O
three	O
pills	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
and	O
it	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
the	O

twice.	O
Once	O
for	O
elevated	B-ADR
bloodb	I-ADR
pressure	I-ADR
and	O
dizziness.	O
other	O
for	O
severe	O
gastritis.	O
Do	O
not	O
take	O
this	O
pill	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
stomach	O
or	O
blood	O
pressure	O
problems.	O
Scary	O
pill!.	O

I	O
am	O
menstruating	B-ADR
with	I-ADR
heavy	I-ADR
bleeding	I-ADR
every	I-ADR
11	I-ADR
days.	O
Honestly,	O
I	O
can't	O
figure	O
out	O
how	O
I	O
can	O
lose	O
this	O
much	O
blood	O
and	O
still	O
function.	O
I	O
have	O
horrific	B-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
to	O
begin	O
with,	O
so	O
I	O
can't	O
say	O
whether	O
arthrotec	B-Drug
increased	O
that.	O
I	O
have	O
endometriosis,	O
so	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
doesn't	O
agree	O
with	O
arthrotec.	O
It	O
did	O
help	O
with	O
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
I	O
experience	O
with	O
the	O
pinched	O
nerve,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
worth	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
continue.	O

It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
but	O
I	O
became	O
so	O
depressed	B-ADR
that	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
told	O
her	O
I	O
refused	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
anymore.	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
effect	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
caused	O
by	O
an	O
interaction	O
with	O
the	O
birth	B-Drug
control	I-Drug
pill.	O
it	O
lowered	O
my	O
numbers,	O
but	O
made	O
my	O

miserable.	O

Had	O
no	O

always	O

Would	O
give	O
it	O
a	O

it	O

the	O

for	O
me.	O
Triglycerides	O

on	O

worked	O
OK,	O
but	O
had	O

a	O

put	O
me	O
on	O
Lipitor.	O
While	O
it	O
did	O

over	O
24	O

my	O

and	O
Gemfibrozil,	O
as	O
well.	O
This	O
went	O
on	O
much	O
too	O
long,	O
mostly	O
due	O
to	O
my	O
inability	O
to	O
make	O

due	O
to	O

I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
severe	O
leg	B-ADR

at	O
night	O
with	O
the	O

traveling	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

as	O
well.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bed	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
crawl	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
take	O
Advil.	O
I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
what	O
could	O
have	O
caused	O
this	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
Recently	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
that	O
stretched	O
to	O
my	O
side	O
and	O
back.	O
The	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
came	O
suddenly	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
before	O
it	O
became	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
sleep.	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
gotten	O
over	O
a	O
urinery	B-ADR
tract	I-ADR
infection	I-ADR
(one	O
of	O
the	O
side-effects)	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
had	O
returned	O
but	O
the	O
symptoms	O
were	O
different.	O
I	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
urge	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
urinate	I-ADR
constantly	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
no	O
symptoms	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
return	O
again.	O
I	O
remembered	O
reading	O
the	O
phamplet	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O
prescription	O
drugs	O
and	O
it	O
mentioning	O
some	O
of	O
symptoms	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
more	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
or	O
urgency.	O
I	O
also	O
had	O
been	O
experiencing	O
lack	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
energy	I-ADR
for	O
quite	O
some	O
time	O
and	O
I	O
attributed	O
this	O
to	O
stress	B-Finding
but	O
after	O
reading	O
this	O
website	O
I	O
feel	O
it	O
was	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
also.	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
I	O
will	O
take	O
this	O
drug	O
anymore	O
and	O
since	O
I	O
read	O
that	O
taking	O
vitamin	B-Drug
C	I-Drug
can	O
help	O
you	O
with	O
your	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
will	O
try	O
this	O
method	O
instead.	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
alternative	O
to	O
lowering	O

than	O
such	O
a	O
potent	O

that	O
can	O
cause	O

many	O

I	O
don't	O

(I'm	O

and	O

is	O
skeptical	O
that	O

is	O
the	O
culprit.	O
I	O
have	O
also	O
noticed	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
short	B-ADR

and	O
am	O
easily	B-ADR

I'm	O
stopping	O
the	O

today	O
and	O

My	O
GP	O
and	O
a	O

were	O
totally	O
unable	O
to	O
diagnose	O
the	O
problem.	O
I	O
tried	O
stopping	O
each	O

I	O
was	O
taking,	O
some	O
allergy/asthma	O
stuff	O
and	O
Lipitor.	O
All	O
the	O
symptoms	O
largely	O
disappeared	O
after	O
two	O
days	O
off	O
Lipitor.	O
Took	O
months	O
for	O
lingering	O
effects	O
to	O
clear	O
completely.	O
Anyone	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
showing	O
any	O
undiagnosed	O
symptoms,	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
awhile	O
as	O
a	O
test.	O

muscle	B-ADR
ache.	O

Doctor	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
prescription	O
for	O
a	O
year's	O
worth	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
for	O
four	O
months	O
and	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
retest	O
before	O
renewing	O
my	O
prescription.	O
In	O
four	O
months,	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
dropped	O
100	O
points,	O
HDL	O
and	O
LDL	O
were	O
in	O
better,	O
though	O
not	O
perfect	O
balance.	O
With	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
at	O
139,	O
I	O
declined	O
to	O
take	O
more	O
Lipitor.	O
Got	O
HDL	O
and	O
LDL	O
into	O
perfect	O
balance	O
within	O
another	O
two	O
months	O
using	O
certain	O
over-the-counter	O
amino	O
acids,	O
tocotrienols,	O
and	O
other	O
nutrients	O
I	O
found	O
online	O
that	O
supposedly	O
do	O
the	O
job.	O
They	O
do!	O
And	O
the	O
nice	O
thing	O
is,	O
if	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
goes	O
up	O
again,	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
very	O
low	O
dose	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
will	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
it.	O
Good	O
stuff!.	O

I	O
am	O
experiencing	O
severe	O
hip	O
joint	B-ADR
pain,	O
thigh	O
pain,	O
severe	O
thigh	O
fatigue	B-ADR
upon	O
minimal	O

is	O
drastically	O
impairing	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
walk	O
anything	O
beyond	O
a	O
relatively	O
short	O
distance.	O
The	O
question	O
is.	O
is	O
lipitor	B-Drug
causing	O
this?	O
I	O
am	O
taking	O
20	O
mg	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
this	O
for	O
6	O
years.	O
This	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
huge	O
problem	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
2.5	O
years.	O
I	O
read	O
this	O
website	O
and	O
feel	O
that	O
lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
causing	O
my	O
pain.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
numberous	O
orthopods,	O
rheumetoligists,	O
neouroligist,	O
and	O
others	O
who	O
cannot	O
find	O
any	O
problems.	O
So,	O
when	O
I	O
read	O
about	O
all	O
these	O
people	O
who	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
figured	O
this	O
out	O
.	O
I	O
have	O
hope.	O
But	O
are	O
they	O
correct	O
in	O
thier	O
assumptions?	O
We	O
are	O
all	O
desperate	O
to	O
find	O
an	O
answer	O
(the	O
cause)	O
and	O
ultimately	O
a	O
cure.	O
But	O
is	O
lipitor	B-Drug
the	O
answer?	O
That	O
is	O
the	O
question	O
(DP	O

I	O

my	O

I've	O
been	O
taking	O

meds	O
for	O
at	O
least	O
10	O
years	O
including	O
Mevacor,	O
Zocor,	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
Zetia.	O
My	O
cholesterol	O
went	O
from	O
398	O
to	O
260	O
on	O
40	O
Lipitor.	O
This	O
year	O
I	O
was	O
given	O
80	O
mgs	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
Zetia	B-Drug
was	O
added	O
as	O
well.	O
Along	O
with	O
the	O
increased	O
dosage,	O
came	O
crippling	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
back,	I-ADR
neck	I-ADR
and	O
then	O
just	O
my	O
left	O
foot,	O
severe	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
neck	I-ADR
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
couldn't	O
hold	O
it	O
up	O
without	O
an	O
effort,	O
increased	O
sinus	B-ADR
pain,	O
high	B-ADR
blood	I-ADR

So	O
to	O
fix	O
all	O
these	O

I	O
was	O

each	O

so	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
great	O

Finally,	O
I	O
realized	O
enough	O
was	O
enough,	O
I	O
called	O
the	O

to	O

she	O
was	O

it's	O

this	O

I	O

He	O
then	O

I	O

Lipitor,	O
5	O
years	O

after	O
a	O

for	O
this	O

such	O
as	O
potassium,	O
magnesium,	O
vitamin	B-Drug
E,	O
etc	O
with	O
no	O
effect,	O
my	O
family	O
doctor	O
suggested	O
that	O
I	O
stop	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
3	O
days,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
it	O
has	O
any	O
effect.	O
The	O
effect	O
was	O
dramatic.	O
The	O
cramps	B-ADR
did	O
not	O
occur	O
during	O
the	O
night	O
after	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
the	O
40	O
mg	O
with	O
my	O
dinner.	O
They	O
also	O
did	O
not	O
occur	O
on	O
the	O
following	O
two	O
nights.	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
restart	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(once	O
a	O
day	O
with	O
the	O
evening	O
meal)	O
for	O
fear	O
that	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
would	O
just	O
as	O
quickly	O
return.	O
Since	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
that	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
night	O
cramps	B-ADR
ceased	O
so	O
quickly	O
is	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
the	O
40	O
mg	O
entirely	O
in	O
the	O
evening,	O
I	O
decided	O

and	O
half	O
in	O
the	O

Although	O
some	O
mild	O
cramping	B-ADR
did	O

it	O
was	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
had	O
know	O
about	O
this	O
a	O

I	O

I	O

if	O
there	O
were	O
any	O

and	O
he	O

no.	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
taking	O

with	O
no	O
problem	O
but	O
insurance	O
company	O
wouldn't	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O
anymore	O
and	O
made	O
me	O
go	O
on	O
lipitor.	O
After	O
about	O
six	O
months	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
docteor	O
write	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
ins.	O
co.	O
saying	O
I	O
couldn't	O
take	O

and	O
they	O
agreed	O
to	O
put	O
me	O
back	O
on	O

But	O
the	O
long	O
term	O
effect	O
of	O
those	O
six	O
months	O
sent	O
me	O
into	O
a	O
psyhcological	B-ADR

that	O
I	O
never	O
recovered	O
from.	O
I	O
went	O

three	O

they	O
finally	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
diagnoses	O
of	O
bipolar	B-Disease
disorder.	O
Cause	O
unknown.	O
This	O
was	O
three	O
years	O

The	O
drug	O
ruined	O
my	O
life,	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
seperated	O
after	O
this	O
all	O
occurred	O
and	O
before	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
an	O
energtic	O

family	O
man	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
wife	O
and	O
two	O
kids.	O
I	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
because	O
the	O
only	O
other	O
medication	O
I	O
take	O
is	O
an	O

I	O
notice	O
a	O

attributed	O
Bell's	B-Disease

to	O

I	O
too	O
had	O
Bell's,	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
my	O
cholesterol	O

and	O
found	O
I	O
got	O
Bell's	B-Disease
before	O
I	O
started	O
on	O

There	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
consistent	O
occurence	O
of	O
muscle	B-Finding

and/or	O

problems	I-Finding
but	O
I	O
wonder	O
how	O
many	O
other	O
problems	O
are	O
not	O
really	O
attributable	O
to	O
lipitor	B-Drug
eg	O
see	O
my	O

Also	O
I	O
get	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
occasional	O
muscle	B-Finding

at	O

since	O
I	O
was	O
a	O

Maybe	O
my	O

However	O
I	O
don't	O
doubt	O
that	O
some	O
unlucky	O

are	O
having	O
bad	O

I	O
just	O
wonder	O
about	O

of	O
the	O
more	O

ones.	O

for	O

and	O

my	O

It	O
really	O

have	O
to	O
wonder	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
doing	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
make	B-ADR
me	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
tired.	O

After	O
about	O
4	O
years	O
of	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
severe	B-ADR
leg	I-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
at	O
night	O
with	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
traveling	O
to	O
my	O
buddocks	O
and	O
stomach	O
as	O
well.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bed	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
crawl	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
to	O
take	O
Advil	B-Drug
for	O
the	O
pain.	O
I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
what	O
could	O
have	O
caused	O
this	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
Recently	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
that	O
stretched	O
to	O
my	O
side	O
and	O
back.	O
The	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
came	O
suddenly	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
before	O
it	O
became	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
sleep.	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
gotten	O
over	O
a	O
urinery	B-Disease
tract	I-Disease
infection	I-Disease
and	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
had	O
returned	O
but	O
the	O
symptoms	O
were	O
different.	O
I	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
urge	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
urinate	I-ADR
constantly	I-ADR
but	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
no	O
symptoms	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
return	O
again.	O
I	O
remembered	O
reading	O
the	O
phamplet	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O
prescription	O
drugs	O
and	O
it	O
mentioning	O
some	O
of	O
symptoms	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
mor.	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
alternative	O
to	O
lowering	O
cholesterol	O
than	O
such	O
a	O
potent	O
drug	O
that	O
can	O
cause	O
so	O
many	O
side	O
effects.	O
I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
case-study	O
when	O
they	O
finally	O
take	O
this	O
drug	O
off	O
the	O
market.	O

two	O
years	O
of	O

many	O
mri's,many	O

for	O

lead	B-ADR
legs.	O
I	O
never	O
stopped	O
searching	O
for	O
an	O
answer	O
and	O
not	O
one	O
doctor	O
picked	O
it	O
up	O
even	O
though	O
that's	O
the	O
first	O
question	O
they	O
ask	O
you.	O
What	O
medicines	O
do	O
you	O
take?	O
Now	O
all	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
push	O
more	O
meds,	O
i	O
am	O
taking	O
neurontin,oxycotin,	O
zanax,	O
and	O
celebrex.	O
BEWARE.	O

I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
lipitor,	O
but	O
shortly	O
after	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it,	O
I	O
exprienced	O
complete	O
paralysis	B-ADR
in	O
my	O
forehead	O
(peripheral	O
neuropathy).	O
Went	O
to	O
a	O
neurologist,GP	O
and	O
ENT,	O
none	O
of	O
whom	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
paralysis	B-ADR
(both	O
sides)	O
with	O
no	O
other	O
symptoms.	O
Has	O
any	O
one	O
else	O
come	O
across	O
this	O
symptom?	O
I	O
m	O
tempted	O
to	O
go	O
off	O
the	O
medicine	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
paralysis	B-ADR
goes	O
away.	O
It	O
really	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholestrol	O
a	O
lot,	O
so	O
I	O
hope	O
this	O
problem	O
isn;t	O
related.	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
reduced	O
my	O
readings	O
to	O
almost	O
normal.	O
At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
suffered	O
from	O

The	O

all	I-ADR
over	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
body	I-ADR
got	O
worse	O
as	O
time	O
went	O
on.	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
left	O
my	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
at	O
home	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
vacation	O
or	O
other	O
trip,	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
feel	O
better.	O
My	O
doctor	O
told	O
me	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
remote	O
possibility	O
that	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
agravating	O
the	O
fibromyalgia.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
feel	O
so	O
much	O
better!	O
But,	O
it	O
seems	O
I	O
buggered	O
up	O
my	O

from	O
all	O
the	O
pain	O
killers	O
that	O
I	O
took.	O
What	O
to	O

the	O

I	O

at	O
a	O

for	O
one	O

twice	O
a	O

he	O

that	O
I	O
was	O

the	O

might	O

extreme.	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
taking	O
the	O

and	O
began	O

back	O
on	O
my	O

After	O
6	O

in	O

I	O
went	O
for	O
more	O

After	O
9	O

I	O
stopped	O
the	O

My	O

I	O

I	O
had	O

It	O

it	O

My	O

it's	O

a	O
year	O
since	O
I	O

I'm	O

I	O

some	O

my	I-ADR

I	O

my	O

I	O

I	O

up	O

I	O
wondered,	O
at	O
first,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
mild	B-Finding
stroke	I-Finding
but	O
found	O
this	O

and	O
realized	O
I	O
was	O
right,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
lowered	O
my	O
chloresterol	O
by	O
eating	O
a	O
bowl	O
of	O
oatmeal	O
at	O
night,	O
for	O
me,	O
just	O
changing	O
my	O
diet	O
was	O
the	O
trick.	O

It's	O
not	O
clear	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
any.	O
I'm	O
concerned	O
that	O
I'm	O
imagining	O
them	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
list	O
of	O
potential	O
side	O
effects.	O
Medicine	O
is	O
scary,	O
but	O
it's	O
sure	O
working.	O
This	O

was	O
prescribed	O
to	O
help	O
with	O
severe	B-Symptom

after	O
1/1	O
(due	O
to	O

Pain	O
was	O
bad	O
enough	O
that	O
I	B-Symptom
had	I-Symptom
trouble	I-Symptom
standing	I-Symptom
up	I-Symptom
from	I-Symptom
sitting	I-Symptom
position.	O
After	O
about	O
24	O
hours,	O
the	O
pain	O
was	O
essentially	O
gone	O
and	O
has	O
stayed	O
gone	O
so	O
far.	O

I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Voltaren-XR	B-Drug

To	O

I	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
also	O

Norvasc	B-Drug
-	O
a	O

pressure	I-Symptom

and	O
when	O
the	O
above	O

persisted	O
I	O
stopped	O
Norvasc	B-Drug
at	O
once	O
(replaced	O
with	O
Diovan).	O
However,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
-	O
over	O
a	O
month	O
ago	O
-	O
I	O
was	O
only	O
aware	O
of	O
Norvasc's	O
side	O
effects	O
and,	O
indeed,	O
when	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
anxiety	B-ADR
and	O
paranoia	B-ADR
symptoms	O
disappeared	O
-	O
most,	O
but	O
not	O
all.	O
That	O
is	O
when	O
I	O
started	O
looking	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
culprit.	O
Sure	O
discovered	O
it	O
soon:	O
Lipitor.	O
Spoke	O
to	O
a	O
psychiatrist	O
and	O
she	O
confirmed	O
that	O
the	O
entire	O
family	O
of	O
Norvasc	B-Drug
(called	O
amlodiphine)	O
is	O
known	O
to	O
have	O
psychiatric	B-ADR
side	O
effects.	O
A	O
month	O
ago	O
my	O
family	O
physician	O
confirmed	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
guilty	O
of	O
similar	O
symptoms	O
and	O
agreed	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
off	O
it	O
for	O
three	O
months,	O
until	O
I	O
take	O
my	O
next	O
blood	O
test.	O
Meanwhile	O
I'm	O
now	O
on	O
health	O

as	O
Q10,	O
Omega	B-Drug
III,	O
Nosterol	B-Drug
and	O
Vitamin	B-Drug
E	I-Drug
(200IU).	O
I	O
now	O
hope	O
that	O
LDL	O
is	O
low	O
enough	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
goodbye.	O
Time	O
will	O

After	O
about	O
1	O

my	O

to	O
60mg.	O
Shortly	O
afterward	O
I	O
began	O
noticing	O
hip	B-ADR

and	O
leg	B-ADR
soreness.	O
It	O
feels	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

Also	O
noticed	O

of	I-ADR

i	O
actually	O

when	O
I	O
bring	O
up	O
the	O

it	O

I	O

Anxiety,	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
about	O
my	O
discovery.	O
First	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
reluctant	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
following	O
meeting	O
he	O
already	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
read	O
about	O
Lipitor's	B-Drug
psychiatric	B-Finding
side	O
effects.	O
He	O
therefore	O
put	O
me	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
completely	O
and	O
suggested	O
a	O
much	O
lower	O
dosage	O
of	O
10mg	O
Crestor.	O
In	O
addition,	O
he	O
prescribed	O
a	O
new	O
medication:	O
Niacin,	O
beginning	O
with	O
500mg	O
the	O
first	O
month	O
and	O
then	O
increasing	O
to	O
1,000	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
(with	O
the	O
ultimate	O
aim	O
of	O
reaching	O
2,000	O
in	O
the	O
fourth	O
monthly).	O
Bottom	O
line:	O
When	O
I	O
discontinued	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
two	O
months	O
ago	O
my	O
LDL	O
reached	O
165.	O
This	O
week	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
indicated	O
an	O
LDL	O
level	O
of	O
124.	O
So,	O
after	O
being	O
helped	O
by	O
folks	O
on	O
this	O

I	O
hope	O
I	O
can	O
be	O
of	O
some	O

Therefore,	O
here	O
is	O
what	O
I've	O
done	O
during	O
the	O
past	O
two	O
months:	O
-	O
Took	O
500mg	O
of	O
Niacin	B-Drug
during	O
the	O
first	O
months	O
and	O
1,000mg	O
during	O
the	O
second;	O
-	O
Took	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
10	O
Crestor	B-Drug
pills	O
(10mg	O
which	O
are	O
equivalent	O
to	O
20mg	O
of	O
Lipitor)	O
per	O

i.e.,	O
one	O
every	O
three	O

-	O
A	O

of	O

two	O

I	O

just	O

there	O
until	O

I	O

this	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
again	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
side	O
effects	O
as	O
before.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
decided	O
to	O
live	O
with	O
high	O
cholesterol	O
as	O
taking	O
this	O
drug	O
made	O
my	O
life	O
not	O
worth	O
living.	O

Was	O
on	O
Provachol.	O
Dr	O
switched	O
me	O
to	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
since	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
effective.	O
After	O
78	O
days	O
on	O
Lipitor,	O
I	O
had	O
constant	B-ADR
low	I-ADR
level	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	O
my	O
butt	O
and	O
upper	O
thighs.	O
Strong	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
randomly.	O
There	O
would	O
be	O
spikes	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
severe	I-ADR
that	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
would	O
collapse.	O
Would	O
have	O
to	O
stop	O
standing/walking	O
and	O
sit	O
down	O
for	O
5	O
or	O
10	O
minutes.	O
After	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
gradually	O
subsided	O
over	O
a	O
9	O
month	O
period.	O
I	O
was	O
pain	B-ADR
free	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
months,	O
but	O
the	O
same	O
pain	B-ADR
has	O
returned	O
and	O
has	O
been	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
past	O
5	O
months.	O
I	O
now	O
wonder	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
chronic	B-Finding
pain	I-Finding
condition.	O

None	O
noticed.	O
I	O
take	O
300	O
mg	O
of	O
coQ10	B-Drug
every	O
day	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
won't	O
have	O
the	O
side	O
effect	O
of	O
muscle	B-Finding
pain.	O
In	O
Canada(	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
Canada	O
)	O
they	O
add	O
coQ10	B-Drug
to	O
the	O
statins.	O
My	O
cholesterol	O
is	O
way	O
down,	O
my	O
inflammation	O
levels	O
are	O
down,and	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
satisfied.	O

sleepy	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
or	I-ADR
most	I-ADR

the	I-ADR
time.	O

My	O
doctor	O
switched	O
me	O
from	O
Pravachol	B-Drug
to	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
almost	O
a	O
year	O
ago	O
because	O
of	O
a	O
study	O
that	O
was	O
done	O
in	O
CHF	O
patients	O
and	O
when	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
used,	O
hospitalizations	O
were	O
cut	O
almost	O
in	O
half.	O
Normally	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
hospital	O
a	O
minimum	O
of	O
2	O
times	O
a	O
year.	O
Since	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
hospital	O
even	O
once!	O
Also,	O
he	O
also	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
better	O
for	O
my	O
kidneys	O
than	O
the	O
statins.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
recently	O
diagnosed	O
with	O
Possible	B-ADR
Early	I-ADR
Parkinson's	I-ADR
symptoms.	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
the	O
only	O
medication	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking.	O
I	O
had	O
joint	B-ADR
pains,	O
light	B-ADR
headedness(problem	I-ADR
keeping	I-ADR

in	I-ADR
Right	I-ADR
hand,	O
and	O
my	O
hand	B-ADR
writting	I-ADR
had	I-ADR
deteriorated	I-ADR
to	O
the	O
extent	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
problem	O
signing	O
cheques.	O
Lipitor(10mg)	O
was	O
very	O
helpful	O
in	O
reducing	O
LDL	O
and	O
Tri-Glycerides,	O
but	O
becuase	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
I	O
have	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
last	O
month.	O
I	O
am	O

a	O

and	O
Fish	B-Drug

(1200mg)	O
once	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
contact	O
others	O
who	O
experienced	O
Parkinson's	B-ADR
symptoms	I-ADR
with	O
Lipitor.	O
///////////////.	O

None.	O
I	O
have	O
taken	O
80	O
mg	O

three	O

no	O

my	O

This	O

--	O
when	O
combined	O
with	O
lifestyle	O

--	O
certainly	O
works	O
well.	O

Possibly	O
diarrhea	B-ADR
and	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain,	O
but	O
most	O
likely	O
none	O
because	O
I	O

this	O
with	O
a	O

antibiotic	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
sinus	B-Disease
infection	I-Disease
that	O
definitely	O
causes	O
diarrhea	B-ADR

I	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
2x/day	O
for	O
7	O
days	O
and	O
then	O
2x/day	O
as	O
needed.	O
I	O
completed	O
the	O
7	O
days	O
and	O
then	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
8th	O
day.	O
The	O
pain	B-Symptom
was	O
immediately	O
worse	O
than	O
before	O
taking	O
Voltaren.	O
It	O

the	O
pain	B-Symptom
in	I-Symptom
my	I-Symptom
knee,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O

I'm	O

that	O
the	O

enables	O
me	O
to	O

the	O

discomfort.	O
I	O

It	O

I	O
was	O

just	O
yesterday	O

I	O

about	O
10	O

complaint	O
with	O

I	O

cause	O
me	O
more	O
pain.	O
The	O
side	O
effects	O
are	O
much	O

than	O
the	O

itself.	O

I	O
was	O
taking	O
75mg	O
only	O
once	O
every	O
three	O

At	O
first	O
it	O
was	O

no	O

I	O
felt	O
fabulous,	O
except	O
I	O
did	O
notice	O

Then	O
the	O

kicked	O
in.	O
Now	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
take	O
only	O
one	O

I	O
have	O

the	O

aren't	O

the	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

today	O
because	O
I	O
was	O

I	O

so	O
I	O
assumed	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
causing	O
me	O
to	O
feel	O
bad.	O
After	O
hearing	O
my	O

my	O

me	O
to	O
using	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
awhile	O
to	O

and	O
that's	O
where	O
I	O
learned	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects.	O
From	O
the	O
info	O
on	O
the	O
web	O
about	O
this	O
medication,	O
it	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
given	O
to	O
anyone.	O
I	O
can't	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
approved	O
at	O
all.	O

I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
after	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-Disease
climbed	I-Disease
to	O
310.	O
I	O
Did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
because	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
vegetarian,	O
a	O
health	O
conscious	O
person	O
and	O
dislike	O
taking	O
medicines,	O
but	O
my	O
doctor,	O
an	O
endocrynologist,	O
strongly	O
recommended	O
it.	O
The	O
first	O
few	O
months	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
aware	O
of	O
any	O
side	O
effects,	O
but	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
ago	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
experience	O
wrist	B-ADR
pain,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
pilates	O
class,	O
but	O
although	O
I	O
rested	O
for	O
2	O
months	O
from	O
the	O
class,	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
continued.	O
Then	O
about	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago,	O
I	O
got	O
very	O
bad	O
cramps	B-ADR
in	O
my	O
toes,	O
they	O
curled	O
down	O
and	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
terrible.	O
About	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
a	O
bath	O
and	O
my	O
muscles	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
lower	I-ADR
abdomen	I-ADR
started	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
contract	I-ADR
then	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
cramp	I-ADR
got	O
higher.	O
I	O
got	O
scared	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
something	O
bad.	O
After	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
one	O
night	O
I	O
had	O
such	O
tiredness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
left	I-ADR
leg	I-ADR
that	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
hardly	I-ADR
walk,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
high	O
heels	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
worn	O
all	O
day.	O
Then	O
2	O
days	O
ago	O
I	O
woke	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
swollen	B-ADR
foot,	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
painful	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
walk.	O
That	O
was	O
it.	O
I	O
suspected	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
internet	O
and	O
read	O
the	O

side	O
effects	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
posting	O
their	O
experiences	O
with	O
this	O

I	O
even	O
thought	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
ALS	B-Disease
since	O
a	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
died	O
of	O
it.	O
It	O
is	O
amazing	O
the	O

that	O
also	O
thought	O
the	O

in	O
this	O

Thanks	O
God	O
for	O
the	O

I	O
stopped	O

this	O

2	O
days	O

I	O
hope	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
these	O
effects	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
permanent.	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
recommend	O
it,	O
unless	O
it	O

than	O

and	O
things	O
of	O
this	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
connect	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
to	O
the	O
terrible	O
low	B-ADR
back	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
I	O
have	O
had	O
for	O
about	O
5	O
months.	O
but	O
after	O
reading	O
comments	O
on	O
this	O
website,	O
I	O
am	O
wondering	O
about	O
this	O
back	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
neck	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
that	O
worsens.	O
It	O
is	O
a	O
miracle	O
drug	O
along	O
with	O
Vitamin	B-Drug
E	I-Drug
and	O
additional	O
Premarin.	O
My	O
cholesterol	O
was	O
over	O
600	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
years	O
back.	O
I've	O
tried	O
at	O
least	O
5	O
other	O
meds	O
for	O
this	O
condition	O
but	O
this	O
one	O
is	O
most	O
effective.	O
The	O
lowest	O
the	O
other	O
ones	O
took	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
300.	O
My	O
endocrinologist	O
thought	O
this	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
controlled.	O
So,	O
I	O
really	O
believe	O
in	O
this	O
drug,	O
but	O
must	O
consider	O
what	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
doing	O
to	O
my	O
body	O
and	O
my	O
degree	O
of	O
pain.	O
I	O
have	O
taken	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
since	O
it	O
was	O
approved	O
4	O
or	O
so	O
years	O
ago.	O
If	O
anyone	O
has	O
any	O
experience	O
like	O
mine,	O
please	O
email	O
me.	O
For	O
the	O
past	O

my	O

Severe	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
both	I-ADR
calfs	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
thighs.	O
I	O
became	O
unable	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
lift	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
put	I-ADR
on	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
pants	I-ADR
or	I-ADR
even	I-ADR
get	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
car.	O
This	O
developed	O
after	O
being	O
on	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
about	O
5	O
years.	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
10	O
mg	O
and	O
complained	O
about	O
discomfort	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
but	O
my	O
cardiologist	O
just	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
old	O
age	O
and	O
even	O
upped	O
my	O
dose	O
to	O
20	O
mg.	O
That	O
really	O
made	O
things	O
a	O
lot	O
worst	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
just	O
stopped	O
it	O
and	O
within	O
24	O
hours	O
could	O
see	O
an	O
improvement.	O
Incidently	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
physician	O
and	O
was	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
myalgia	B-ADR
with	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
but	O
I	O
suspect	O
it	O
is	O
much	O
worst	O
than	O
the	O
drug	O
company	O
would	O
have	O
you	O
believe.	O
This	O
is	O
really	O
a	O
very	O
toxic	O
drug	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
used	O
with	O
caution.	O
This	O
is	O
a	O
drug	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
effective	O
in	O
lowering	O
cholesterol	O
but	O
also	O
affects	O
many	O
metabolic	O
pathways	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
and	O
is	O
potentially	O
dangerous.	O

Lethargy,	O
fuzzy	B-ADR
thinking,	O
blurry	B-ADR
vision,	O
dull	O
muscle	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
constantly.	O
It	O
has	O
done	O
almost	O
nothing	O
for	O
my	O
Triglycerides,	O
nor	O
has	O
it	O
elevated	O
my	O
HDL.	O
My	O
LDL	O
and	O
total	O
Cholesteral,	O
however	O
responded	O
quite	O
favorably.	O
Make	O
sure	O
you	O
don't	O
take	O
Lopid	B-Drug
with	O
this.	O
It	O
can	O
damage	B-ADR
your	I-ADR
heart	I-ADR
and	O
keep	O
you	O
short	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
breath	I-ADR
and	O
constantly	B-ADR
weak.	O

None	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
5	O
years.	O
It	O
DID	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol.	O
However,	O
in	O
the	O
6th	O
year,	O
I	O
developed	O
terrible	O
ankle/knee/leg/hip	B-ADR
pain,	O
aching	B-ADR
and	O
soreness.	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
muscle	B-ADR
problem.	O
I	O
got	O
so	O
weak	B-ADR
I	O
had	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
use	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
cane	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
walk.	O
Then,	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
handicapped	O
carts	O
in	O
the	O
grocery	O
store.	O
Then	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
handicapped	O
permit	O
because	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
walk	I-ADR
more	O
than	O
25	O
steps.	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
sleep	I-ADR
for	O
the	O
ache	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
discomfort	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs.	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
away	O
from	O
a	O
wheelchair.	O
I	O
was	O
horribly	O
depressed.	O
When	O
I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
about	O
this	O
pain,	O
he	O
took	O
me	O
off	O
Lipitor,	O
and	O
within	O
one	O
week	O
my	O
pain	B-ADR
had	O
stopped	O
completely.	O
I	O
can	O
walk	O
fine,	O
I	O
can	O
even	O
run.	O
I	O
sleep	O
like	O
a	O
baby.	O
However,	O
I	O
still	O
cannot	O
walk	O
very	O
far	O
-	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
lost	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
muscle	O
tone.	O
I	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
build	O
my	O
strength	O
back	O
up	O
in	O
my	O
legs.	O
Otherwise,	O
I	O
feel	O
ten	O
years	O
younger.	O

Disorentatation,trouble	O

extreme	B-ADR
hot,	O

and	I-ADR

later	O
abominal	B-ADR
cramps.	O
All	O
this	O
came	O
all	O
sudden	O
in	O
couple	O
of	O
minutes.	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
taking	O
arthrotec	B-Drug
before	O
for	O
my	O
knee	B-Symptom
pain	I-Symptom
and	O
it	O
helped	O
me	O
a	O
lot.	O
I	O
only	O
had	O
10-12	O
pills	O
left	O
from	O
last	O
March	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
cortisone	B-Drug
shot	I-Drug
and	O
my	O
knee	B-Symptom
pain	I-Symptom
went	O
away.	O

I	O
had	O
severe	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
weakness	B-ADR
after	O
taking	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
doses	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O
My	O
legs	B-ADR
were	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
weak	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
tired	I-ADR
I	O
could	B-ADR
hardly	I-ADR
walk	I-ADR
up	O
and	O
down	O
my	O
stairs.	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
symptoms	O
subsided.	O
At	O
my	O
doctor's	O
suggestion,	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
again	O
and	O
experienced	O
the	O
same	O
symptoms.	O
This	O
was	O
with	O
only	O
a	O
small	O
dosage	O
(I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
10mg).	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
function;	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
felt	O
such	O
weakness.	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
taking	O
Zocor,	O
which	O
certainly	O
has	O
side	O
effects,	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
function.	O

Severe	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
joint	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	O
left	O
leg.	O
My	O
cardiologist	O
started	O
with	O
a	O
dosage	O
of	O
80	O
mg	O
which	O
seems	O
very	O
high.	O
Symptoms	O
started	O
after	O
second	O
dose.	O
After	O
third	O
dose	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
so	O
severe	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
hardly	I-ADR
move.	O
I	O
stopped	O
Lipitor.	O
The	O
doctor	O
recommended	O
laying	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
then	O
restarting.	O
NO	O
WAY!	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
has	O
gradually	O
subsided	O
but	O
it	O
has	O
not	O
disappeared	O
over	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
several	O
months.	O
This	O
stuff	O
is	O
poison.	O
I	O
would	O
rather	O
take	O
my	O
chances	O
of	O
a	O
heart	B-Disease
attack	I-Disease
than	O
live	O
with	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
experienced	O
weight	B-ADR
gain	I-ADR
because	O
my	O
level	O
of	O
activity	O
has	O
dropped.	O

i	O
have	O
experienced	O
extreme	B-ADR
stomach	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
when	O
taken	O
on	O
an	O
empty	O
stomach,	O
and	O
moderate	B-ADR
stomach	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
when	O
taken	O
with	O
food.	O
i	O
also	O
had	O
some	O
drowsiness	B-ADR
after	O
taking	O
arthrotec.	O
arthrotec	B-Drug
works	O
very	O
well	O
for	O
my	O
knee	B-Symptom
pain,	O
more	O
so	O
than	O
mobic	B-Drug
or	O
celebrex.	O
however,	O
i	O
do	O
experience	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
from	O
time	O
to	O
time.	O

Terrific	O
cramps	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
and	O
awful	O
gas	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
abdomen	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
back	I-ADR
for	O
the	O
last	O
month	O
at	O
least.	O
It	O
lowered	O
my	O
LDL	O
(not	O
enough)	O
but	O
also	O
lowered	O
my	O
HDL	O
as	O
well!!	O
The	O
ratio	O
is	O
not	O
good!.	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
about	O
3	O
yrs.	O
ago.	O
I	O
started	O
at	O
20.	O
then	O
my	O
Dr	O
doubled	O
it	O
to	O
40	O
and	O
kept	O
wanting	O
me	O
to	O
double	O
it	O
again	O
to	O
80.	O
After	O
me	O
telling	O
him	O
for	O
months	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
do	O
this.	O
I	O
gave	O
it	O
(about	O
2	O
months	O
ago)	O
but	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
60	O
rather	O
than	O
80.	O
Well,	O
let	O
me	O
tell	O
you	O
after	O
taking	O
this	O
increased	O
dosage	O
for	O
about	O
two	O
months	O
I've	O
had	O
such	O
gas	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
abdomen	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
back	I-ADR
and	O
also	O
leg	B-ADR
cramps.	O
I	O
finally	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
Dr	O
in	O
Urgent	O
Care	O
as	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
so	O
severe.	O
He	O
examined	O
me	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
any	O
swellings	O
etc	O
and	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
anything	O
different	O
with	O
my	O
meds.	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
increased	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
he	O
suggested	O
that	O
I	O
stop	O
taking	O
it	O
ASAP.	O
I	O
only	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
last	O
night	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
anticipating	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
feel	O
better	O
(I	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
physical	O
and	O
do	O
lots	O
of	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O
growing	O

worse	O
for	O
the	O

I	O
blamed	O
it	O
on	O
stress	B-Finding
(with	O
a	O

arthritis,	O
advancing	O

etc	O
and	O
even	O
discussed	O
leg	B-ADR

and	O
body	B-ADR

with	O
my	O

which	O
he	O
attributed	O
chiefly	O
to	O

I	O
even	O
had	O
tests	O
done	O
on	O

if	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
the	O

as	O
I	O
have	O
an	O
aortic	B-Finding

thought	O
perhaps	O
my	O

could	O
be	O
from	O

somewhere.	O
They	O
all	O
checked	O

It	O
has	O
been	O

for	O
several	O

I	O
suffered	O

I	O

I	O

A	O

I	O
began	O

in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

my	I-ADR

as	O
a	O

(It	O
seemed	O

Then	O
the	O

started	I-ADR

I	O
nearly	O

to	O

to	O

I	O
stopped	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
as	O
an	O
experiment,	O
and	O
after	O

I	O

I	O
experienced	O
for	O
over	O
6	O
months	O
while	O
taking	O
this	O

For	O
the	O
first	O
8	O
days	O
of	O
ever	O
taking	O
it,	O
the	O
only	O
side	O
effect	O
was	O
a	O
similar	O
feeling	O
you	O
get	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
an	O
empty	O
stomach	O
and	O
light	B-ADR
nausea	I-ADR
that	O
lasted	O
for	O
no	O

that	O
30	O

After	O
8	O
days,	O
the	O
feeling	O
elevated	O
to	O
an	O
annoying	O
sharp	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
stomach.	O
Then	O
two	O
days	O
later,	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
using	O
it	O
because	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
becoming	I-ADR
unbearable.	O
Now	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
off	O
for	O
two	O
days	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
the	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain.	O
Aside	O
from	O
the	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain,	O
it	O
worked	O
miracle	O
on	O
my	O
nighttime	O
spinal	B-Symptom
pain.	O
Now	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
doctor	O
again	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
should	O
keep	O
taking	O
it.	O
I	O
tried	O
Naprosyn	B-Drug
just	O
before	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
reasons.	O

I	O
developed	O
severe	O
abdominal	B-ADR
pains,	O
severe	B-ADR
welts	I-ADR
all	O
over	O
my	O

from	O

The	O

with	O
time.	O
They	O
included	O
fluid	B-ADR
retention,	O
all	O
over	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain,	O
cramps.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
them	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
and	O
felt	O
much	O
better	O
the	O
next	O
day.	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
haven't	O
totally	O
disappeared	O
but	O
I'm	O
improving	O
with	O
each	O
day.	O
My	O
doctor	O
doesn't	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
medication	O
could	O
cause	O
this	O
reaction.	O

I	O
took	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
about	O
a	O
year.	O
I	O
had	O
vague	O
muscle	B-ADR
aches	I-ADR
and	O
almost	O
overnight	O
developed	O
low	B-ADR
back	I-ADR

where	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
roll	O
out	O

in	O
order	O
to	O
stand	O
up	O
without	O

I	O

my	O

I	O

I	O
NEVER	O

What	O
else	O
could	O
I	O
attribute	O
this	O

to?	O
Why	O
is	O
there	O
such	O
denial	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
damage	O
this	O

can	O
do.	O
I	O

I	O

I	O

the	O

a	O

it	O

my	I-ADR

I	O
called	O
my	O
doctor	O
who	O
took	O
me	O
off	O
the	O
10	O
mg.	O
dosage.	O
Looking	O
back	O
I	O
realize	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
symptoms	O
early	O
on	O
but	O
chose	O
to	O
overlook	O
them.	O
Bad	O
choice	O
on	O
my	O
part.	O
I	O
hope	O
now	O
that	O
the	O
9	O
months	O
of	O
taking	O
these	O
meds	O
hasn't	O
caused	O
permanent	O
damage	O
!!.	O
After	O
reading	O
more	O
about	O
the	O
medication	O
I	O
can	O
only	O
say	O
that	O
for	O
me.	O
I	O
am	O
done	O
with	O
taking	O
statins.	O
I	O
will	O
control	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
by	O
losing	O
weight,exercise	O
and	O
diet.	O
It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
total	O

my	O

but	O
the	O
effect	O
it	O
had	O
on	O
my	O
overall	O
well	O

was	O
too	O
devastating.	O

worked	O
very	O
well;	O
it	O
took	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
for	O
noticeable	O
results,	O
but	O
the	O
relief	O
was	O
definite	O
and	O
lasting.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
after	O
4-5	O

Clearly,	O
there	O
was	O

that	O

I	O

of	O

along	O
with	O
a	O
9	O

of	O
Aciphex	B-Drug
on	O
4/25	O
(three	O
bottles	O
of	O
three	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
solution	O
my	O

came	O
up	O
with.	O
I've	O
never	O
had	O
consistant	O
heart	B-Finding

or	O

no	O

so	O
I	O
was	O
confused	O
as	O
to	O
why	O
he	O
would	O
offer	O
me	O
this	O
medication.	O
The	O
first	O
day	O
I	O
took	O
both	O

I	O
experienced	O
some	O
dizziness	B-ADR
and	O
some	O
nausea	B-ADR
and	O
some	O
serious	O
period	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
cramps.	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
work,	O
so	O
I	O
just	O
had	O
to	O
brush	O
it	O
off.	O
It	O
continued	O
each	O
time	O
I	O
took	O
it.	O
After	O
about	O
two	O
days	O
(two	O
doses),	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
continued	O
and	O
began	O
inhibiting	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
menstrual	I-ADR
cycle	I-ADR
(which	O
I	O
was	O
due	O
to	O

So,	O
I	O
googled	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
of	O
the	O

came	O
across	O

realized	O
I	O
wasn't	O
the	O
only	O
one	O

I	O
felt	O

about	O
it.	O
On	O
the	O

no	O

All	O

for	O

I've	O

I	O
started	O
to	O
take	O
20	O
mg	O
lipitor	B-Drug
in	O
August	O
2006,	O
after	O
6	O

I	O
reduced	O
to	O
take	O
10	O

and	O
after	O
another	O
6	O

I	O
reduced	O
the	O

I	O
did	O

When	O
I	O
incresed	O
lipitor	B-Drug
from	O
5	O
mg	O
to	O
10	O
mg	O
about	O
3	O
months	O

I	O
started	O
to	O
experience	O
the	O

at	O

and	O
some	O

About	O
2	O
months	O
ago	O
while	O
I	O
first	O
told	O
my	O
doctor	O
I	O
lost	B-ADR
some	I-ADR
body	I-ADR
balance	I-ADR
and	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
lipitor	B-Drug
buy	O
my	O
doctor	O
told	O
me	O
the	O
side	O
effect	O
was	O
most	O
likely	O
by	O
some	O
other	O
reason(s).	O
During	O
my	O
second	O
visiting	O
him,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
CK	O
is	O
90	O
and	O
my	O
muscle	O
should	O
be	O
OK.	O
Then	O
I	O
continued	O
to	O
take	O
10	O
mg	O
lipitor,	O
but	O
I	O
felt	O
more	O
on	O
muscle	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
joint	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
feel	O
I	O
lost	B-ADR
some	I-ADR
memory.	O
Therefore,	O
I	O
deeply	O
believed	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
side	O
effects	O
by	O
taking	O
lipitor.	O
After	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
10	O
day	O
without	O
lipitor,	O
I	O
got	O
my	O
memory	O
back	O
to	O
nomal	O
level	O
and	O
my	O
body	O
balance	O
is	O
getting	O
better.	O
During	O
my	O
third	O
doctor	O
visit,	O
my	O
doctor	O
finally	O
believed	O
that	O
I	O
got	O
bad	O
side	O
effects	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
months	O
for	O
recovery.	O
Now	O
my	O
doctor	O
wants	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
B3	B-Drug
or	O
Niaspan	B-Drug
instead	O
of	O
lipitor.	O

I	O
took	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
about	O
2	O
months	O
two	O
years	O
ago	O
and	O
it	O
completely	O
changed	O
my	O
life.	O
My	O
muscles	O

have	O
suffered	O
from	O
this.	O
I	O

I	O
was	O
a	O

needless	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
will	O
never	O
be	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
weakness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

I	O
would	O

i	O

very	O

with	O

became	O
more	O
anxious	B-ADR
about	O
EVERYTHING,	O
and	O
noticed	O
words	B-ADR
would	I-ADR
not	I-ADR
form	I-ADR
in	O
my	O

during	O

was	O
disturbing	O
and	O
couldn't	O
figure	O
out	O
why	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
happening.	O
made	O
me	O
think	O
i	O
needed	O
antidepressants	O
or	O
something	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
constant	O
anxiety/fear	O
(which	O
i	O
have	O
taken	O
before	O
and	O
are	O
horrible	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
of)	O
have	O
noticed	O
slightly	O
more	O
tingling	B-ADR
and	O
weird	O
pains,	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
perfect	O
time	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
this.	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
another	O
post.	O
what	O
are	O
they	O
doing	O
to	O
us,	O
in	O
the	O
interest	O
of	O
healing	O
us?	O
I	O
did	O
take	O
the	O
actual	O
lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
several	O
yrs,	O
and	O
it	O
did	O
lower	O
cholesteral,	O
but	O
started	O
experiencing	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
tingley	I-ADR
thing	I-ADR
and	O
stopped	O
,	O
then	O
started	O
with	O
the	O
Atorvastatin,	O
where	O
i	O
noticed	O
the	O
above	O
side	O
affects.	O
be	O
very	O
aware	O
of	O
any	O
physical/emotional	B-ADR
changes.	O

After	O
using	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
2.5	O
years,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
because	O
of	O
severe	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
left	I-ADR
arm.	O
I	O
am	O
left	O
handed	O
and	O
recently	O
couldn't	O
normally	O
do	O
my	O
job.	O
Twice	O
I	O
told	O
my	O
doctor	O
about	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arm	I-ADR
and	O
he	O
didn't	O
take	O
that	O
seriously,	O
ignoring	O
my	O
complaint.	O
After	O
two	O
weeks	O
of	O
not	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
my	O
arm	O
almost	O
recovered	O
and	O
I	O
can	O
work	O
without	O
any	O
pain	B-ADR
or	O
any	O
problem.	O
It	O
started	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
ago	O
with	O
tingling	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms,	O
they	O
were	O
often	O
fall	O
asleep,	O
usually	O
when	O
I	O
wake	O
up	O
in	O
the	O

From	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
worst	O
until	O
I	O
almost	O
lost	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
strength	I-ADR
and	O
couldn't	B-ADR
use	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arm.	O
Anyway,	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
good	O
decision	O
by	O
not	O
using	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
anymore	O
(my	O
doctor	O
will	O
be	O
mad	O
at	O
me).	O
I	O
will	O

I	O

two	O

and	O
my	O

is	O
beginning	O
to	O
go	O
away.	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
recommend	O
this	O

even	O
though	O
it	O
did	O
work	O
to	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol.	O

No	O
side	O

so	O
far.	O
Reduced	O
total	O

167	O
and	O
reduced	O
total	O
triglycerides	O
to	O

I	O
never	O
had	O
a	O

until	O
after	O
a	O

This	O
could	O
be	O

I	O
have	O
spotting	B-ADR
and	O
it	O
had	O
started	O
2	O

I	O
had	O
stopped	O
taking	O
them	O
for	O
3	O
weeks	O
now	O
and	O
still	O
have	O
spotting	B-ADR
problems,	O
I	O
talked	O
to	O
doctors	O
and	O
they	O
just	O
shrugged	O
it	O
off.	O
And	O
then	O
told	O
me	O
go	O

I	O

While	O

will	O

and	O
they	O
may	O
run	O
a	O

I	O
stopped	O

the	O

the	O

About	O
a	O

this	O

the	O

that	O

that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
more	O

the	O

She	O
took	O
herself	O
off	O

the	O

her	O
symptoms	O
also	O
began	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

it	O

the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
.	O
It	O
was	O
the	O

So,	O
I	O
just	O
quit	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
within	O
3	O

I	O

quit	O

call	O
your	O

There	O
are	O

why	O
some	O

HAVE	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
a	O
statin	O
in	O
some	O
cases.	O

Was	O

cramping	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
stomach,	O
and	O
some	O
muscle	O
side	O
effects.	O
I	O
decided	O

go	O
off	O

it	O
after	O
a	O
few	O
months.	O
When	O
my	O
Cholesterol	O
shot	O
up	O

I	O
reconsidered	O

I	O
cut	O
the	O
dosage	O
in	O
half	O
with	O
a	O
pill	O

taking	O
only	O
5mg	O

This	O
is	O
something	O

should	O

Where	O
the	O

my	O

went	O
down	O

on	O

a	O

from	O

now	O
(after	O

It	O
took	O

this	O

almost	I-ADR

many	O
doctors	O
just	O
ignore	O
the	O
side	O

of	O
this	O

I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Zipsor	B-Drug
for	O
bone	B-Symptom
and	I-Symptom
joint	B-Symptom
pain	I-Symptom
associated	O

I	O

I	O
have	O
always	O

a	O

(almost	O

The	O
Zipsor	B-Drug
works	O
well	O
on	O
the	O

but	O
also	O
almost	O
completely	O
wiped	O
out	O
the	O

from	I-Symptom
the	I-Symptom
herniated	I-Symptom

and	O
has	O
replaced	O
my	O

for	O
my	O

As	O
with	O
any	O
disc	B-Finding

there	O
seems	O

First	O
-	O
WOW!	O
Second	O
-	O
okay	O
I	O
just	O

I'll	O

that	O

maybe	O

relief.	O

At	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
as	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
began	O
experiencing	O
chest	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
soreness	I-ADR
and	O
spazms	B-ADR
which	O
have	O
persisted.	O
I	O
now	O
take	O
neurontin,	O
an	O
anti-seizure	O
drug	O
together	O
with	O
pain	O
killers	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
problems.	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
three	O
blood	O
tests	O
over	O
time	O
which	O
indicate	O
that	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
not	O
damaging	O
the	O
muscles.	O
I	O
remain	O
suspicious	O
that	O
lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
contributing	O
to	O
my	O
muscle	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
(physiotherpist	O
say	O
there	O
is	O
other	O
causes)	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
denying	O
that	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
levels	O
have	O
been	O
improved	O
(they	O
never	O
were	O
that	O
bad).	O

after	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
it	O
for	O
3	O
months,started	O
breaking	O
out	O
in	O
blisters,and	O
my	O
face	O
looked	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
fire.	O
the	O
dr	O
took	O
me	O
off	O
of	O
it.	O
but	O
it	O
helped	O
my	O
cholestrol.	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
clinically	O
proved	O
my	O
theory	O
yet	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
4	O
years	O
ended	O
up	O
giving	O
me	O
Multiple	B-ADR
Sclerosis.	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
37	O
yr	O
old	O
male,	O
I	O
was	O
diagnosed	O
with	O
MS	B-ADR
two	O
months	O
ago.	O
My	O
cholesterol	O
was	O
it's	O
highest	O
at	O
212	O
when	O
my	O
GP	O
prescribed	O
the	O
drug.	O
My	O
total	O
cholesterol	O
while	O
on	O
it	O
got	O
down	O
to	O
130	O
ish.	O
This	O
is	O
too	O
low	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
and	O
my	O
body	O
began	O
attacking	O
my	O
CNS	O
and	O
now	O
have	O
to	O
live	O
with	O
this.	O
Again,	O
this	O
has	O
not	O
yet	O
proven,	O

have	O
i	O

the	O
longer	O
I	O
took	O
it.	O
It	O
became	O
so	O
extreme	O
-	O
it	O
was	O
causing	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
dysfunctional.	O
The	O
final	O
week	O
it	O
turned	O
into	O
extreme	B-ADR
vomiting	I-ADR
and	O
diarrhea.	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
flu	B-Finding
bug	I-Finding
that	O
just	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
away.	O
As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
quit	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
-	O
I	O
had	O
my	O

I	O
also	O
experienced	O
memory	B-ADR

and	O
extreme	B-ADR
tiredness.	O
I	O
might	O
also	O
mention	O
that	O
I	O
started	O
on	O
10mg	O
and	O
experienced	O
really	O
no	O
side	O

but	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
up'd	O
to	O
20	O
mg	O
it	O
all	O
started	O
to	O
go	O
downhill.	O

I've	O
been	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O

me	O
that	O
my	O

mentioned	O
something	O
about	O
muscle	B-Finding

and	O
am	O
wondering	O
if	O
this	O
could	O
be	O
the	O

I	O
will	O

meant	O
I	O

I	O
was	O
advised	O
to	O
take	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
with	O
Zantac	B-Drug
when	O
necessary,	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
counter	O
the	O

awful.	O
I	O
will	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
live	O
with	O
the	O
foot	B-Symptom
pain	I-Symptom
because	O
I	O
simply	O
cannot	O
go	O
through	O
this	O
again.	O
I	O
would	O
strongly	O
recommend	O
never	O
going	O

this	O

I	O

it	O
a	O

knee	B-Symptom

so	O
I	O
lived	O
with	O
it.	O
Then	O
my	O

increased	O
the	O

after	O
one	O

and	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
anything	O

Unfortunately,	O
I	O

it,	O
its	O
an	O

With	O

I	O
know	O
that	O

so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

Long	O

I	O

with	O
a	O

I	O

it	O

the	O

I	O
went	O

I	O

now,	O
I	O
am	O
fairly	O
certain	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Voltaren.	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
that	O
my	O

3	O

the	O

That	O

Took	O
the	O

the	O
next	O

Upon	O
arising	O
on	O
the	O

I	O

cramping	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
both	I-ADR

(above	I-ADR

I	O
was	O
not	B-ADR

anything.	O
Spent	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
in	O

reading	O
a	O

something	O
I	O
rarely	O

By	O
the	O
afternoon	O
I	O
could	O

Felt	B-ADR
generally	I-ADR
terrible,	O
flu	B-ADR
like	I-ADR

lower	B-ADR

pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR

I	O
had	O
a	O
worse	B-ADR

than	I-ADR

(I	I-ADR
have	I-ADR

but	O
who	O
knows?	O
Went	O
to	O
the	O
internet	O
and	O
found	O
this	O
site.	O
Saw	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
commercial	O
on	O
TV	O
warning	O
about	O
muscle	O
pain.	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
the	O
tablet	O
today,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
feeling	O
better.	O
I	O
attribute	O
the	O
condition	O
to	O
the	O
Lipitor,	O
although	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
proof.	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
prostate	B-Finding
cancer	I-Finding
patient	O
and	O
take	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
other	O
drugs,	O
which	O
raise	O
the	O
LDL.	O
Apparently,	O
some	O
(a	O
few)	O
patients	O
cannot	O
tolerate	O
this	O
drug.	O
I	O
note	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
on	O
this	O
list	O
who	O
have	O
permanent	O
damage,	O
so	O
it	O
is	O
serious	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
us.	O
My	O
legs	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
still	I-ADR
sore,	O
and	O
feel	O
worse	O
than	O
they	O
did	O
after	O
a	O
day	O
of	O
agressive	O
downhill	O
skiing	O
a	O
week	O
ago.	O
Apparently	O
this	O
works	O
for	O
most,	O
but	O
some	O
people	O
have	O
a	O
severe	O
and	O
not	O
so	O
obvious	O
reaction.	O
Stop	O
immediately	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
muscle	B-Finding
pain.	O

Soon	O
after	O
starting	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
developed	O
extreme	O
pain	B-ADR
in	O
both	O
inner	O
arms	O
at	O
the	O
elbows,	O
over	O
the	O
next	O

I	O
developed	O

my	O

Also	O
Nerve	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	O

Finally	O
extreme	O
burning	B-ADR
of	I-ADR

I	O
was	O
started	O
on	O
Liptor	B-Drug
20	O

7	O
years	O

It	O
was	O
increased	O
to	O

3	O

The	O
pain	B-ADR
increased	O
proportionately	O
to	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
drug	O
and	O
the	O
dose	O
increase.	O
Neither	O
my	O
doctors	O
nor	O
I	O
ever	O
related	O
these	O
pains	O
to	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
stopped	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
six	O
months	O
ago	O
as	O
an	O
experiment.	O
Within	O
3	O
weeks	O
I	O
had	O

about	O
50%.	O
I	O

not	O

past	O
this	O

I	O
still	O
can't	O

I	O

than	I-Symptom
my	I-Symptom

but	I-Symptom
they	I-Symptom
still	I-Symptom
hurt.	O
My	O

the	O

who	O
says	O
I	O
now	O
need	O
surgery	O
on	O
both	O

for	O
the	O
inflammed	B-Disease
bursae	I-Disease
are	O
reluctant	O

My	O

still	O
wants	O
me	O
on	O
statins.	O
She	O
is	O
annoyed	O
that	O
I	O

I	O

Red	B-Drug

No	O

if	O
the	O

my	O

I	O
was	O
never	O

the	O

I	O
have	O

were	O
in	O
any	O

Lipitor.	O

Took	O
Liptor	B-Drug
for	O
3	O
months	O
2	O
years	O

Developed	O
severe	B-ADR
thigh	I-ADR

(both	I-ADR

and	O
could	B-ADR

75	I-ADR
feet.	O
Took	O
myself	O
off	O
Liptor	B-Drug
and	O
all	O
symtoms	O
went	O
completely	O
away.	O
Then	O
my	O
doctor	O
had	O
a	O
bright	O
idea	O
to	O
try	O
Liptor	B-Drug
again	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
symtoms	O
came	O
back.	O
Problem	O
is,	O
went	O
off	O
this	O
drug	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
muscle	B-ADR
problem	I-ADR
and	O
at	O
times	O
can	B-ADR
hardly	I-ADR
walk!	O
Now	O
the	O
top	B-ADR
outer	I-ADR
thigh	I-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
starts	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
feel	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
warm,	I-ADR
then	I-ADR
get	I-ADR
numb	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
lastly	I-ADR
it	I-ADR
starts	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
feel	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
cool	I-ADR
(Like	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
icy	I-ADR
hot	I-ADR
patch).	O
This	O
drug	O
is	O
so	O
bad,	O
I	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
normal	O
self,	O
but	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
the	O

has	O
been	O
done!	O
Am	O

finally	O
where	O
they	O

be.	O

For	O
about	O
15	O
months	O
I	O
experienced	O
SEVERE	B-ADR
fatigue,	O
and	O
initially	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
months	O
very	B-ADR
bad	I-ADR
headaches	I-ADR
which	O
diminished	O
in	O

never	O

Insomnia,	O
I	O
would	O

Difficulty	B-ADR
in	I-ADR

I	O
went	O
to	O
3	O
different	O
doctors	O
for	O
these	O
symptoms.	O
All	O
of	O
them	O
dismissed	O
my	O
view	O
that	O
maybe	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
causing	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
even	O
though	O
the	O
symptoms	O
started	O
about	O
3	O
weeks	O
after	O
uping	O
the	O
dosage	O
from	O
20	O
mg.	O

I	O
quit	O

about	O
a	O

Headaches	B-ADR
seem	O
to	O
be	O
dissipating	O
as	O
well,	O
and	O
the	O
extreme	B-ADR
fatigue	I-ADR
is	O
disappearing.	O
I	O
don't	O
expect	O
MD's	O
to	O
be	O
knowledgeable	O
about	O
every	O

and	O
I	O
recognize	O
that	O
this	O

has	O
probably	O
saved	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
attitude	O
that	O
I	O
find	O
irresponsible,	O
that	O
these	O
problems	O
couldn't	O
possibly	O
be	O
caused	O
by	O
Lipitor	B-Drug

I	O

that	O

this	O

be	O
a	O

back	O
to	O
my	O
old	O

I	O
feel.	O
Oh	O
yes,	O
and	O
I	O
also	O
suffered	O
from:	O

and	O

It	O
lowered	O
my	O

to	O
be	O

But	O
it	O
also	O
significantly	O
lowered	O
my	O
quality	O
of	O
life.	O
This	O
website	O
has	O
been	O
an	O
absolute	O
lifeline	O
for	O
me.	O
My	O
doctor	O
had	O
seemed	O
so	O
completely	O
unwilling	O
to	O
accept	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
could've	O
possibly	O
been	O
related	O
to	O
my	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	O
However,	O
I	O
know	O
my	O
body	O
and	O
know	O
when	O
things	O
are	O
not	O
as	O
they	O
should	O
be.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
feeling	O
this	O
way	O
since	O
almost	O
immediately	O
after	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
first	O
dose.	O
Hearing	O
that	O
so	O
many	O
other	O
people	O
have	O
experienced	O
the	O
same	O
exact	O
symptoms	O
as	O
me	O
has	O
given	O
me	O
the	O
courage	O
needed	O
to	O
STOP	O
this	O
medication.	O
So	O
many	O
of	O
my	O
family	O
members	O
and	O
friends	O
have	O
had	O
bad	O
reactions	O
to	O
this	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
trust	O
it,	O
and	O
will	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
another	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
under	O
control,	O
if	O
possible.	O
Be	O
very	O
careful	O
and	O
very	O
informed	O
before	O
you	O
start	O
any	O

Don't	O
always	O
trust	O
the	O
word	O
of	O
your	O

as	O
the	O
only	O
word	O
and	O
take	O
it	O
at	O
its	O
face	O
value.	O
When	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
your	O

you	O
have	O
every	O
right	O
to	O
dictate,	O
understand,	O
and	O
call	O
the	O

about	O
what	O

however	O
the	O

I	O
stopped	O

right	O
away	O
when	O
a	O

told	O
me	O
that	O
her	O
supposedly	O
'fibromyalgia'	O

when	O
she	O
stopped	O
the	O

Too	O

taking	O
lipitor	B-Drug
or	O
all	O

It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O

but	O
I	O
don't	O
need	O
to	O

Now	O
I	O

It	O
does	O
lower	O
my	O

from	O
300	O
to	O
175	O
I	O
stopped	O
it	O
for	O
1	O
month	O
my	O

went	O
up	O

I	O
suggest	O

to	O
research	O
more	O
about	O
all	O

in	O
fact	O
she	O

they	O

the	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
know	O
my	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
me.	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
stop	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
happens.	O

For	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
remember	O
I've	O
always	O
had	O
perfect	O
cholesterol	O
(from	O
a	O
percentage	O
perspective	O
anyway).	O
It's	O
always	O
been	O
right	O
around	O
120/120.	O
For	O
what	O
ever	O
reason	O
my	O
LDL	O
shot	O
up	O
to	O
175	O
so	O
a	O
(not	O
my	O
normal	O
one)	O
Dr	O
just	O
prescribed	O
me	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
didn't	O
notice	O
any	O
problems	O
for	O
just	O
over	O
2	O
months	O
then	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
one	O
day	O
I	O
stared	O
feeling	B-ADR
horrible	I-ADR
like	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
severe	I-ADR
flu	I-ADR
just	I-ADR
hit	I-ADR
me.	O
For	O
the	O
next	O
few	O
days	O
I	O
couldn't	B-ADR
get	I-ADR
enough	I-ADR
sleep	I-ADR
I	O
was	B-ADR
incredibly	I-ADR
week	I-ADR
and	O
had	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
throughout	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
upper	I-ADR
body.	O
I	O
saw	O
my	O
regular	O
Dr	O
and	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
the	O
drug,	O
she	O
also	O
drew	O
blood.	O
Luckily	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
tests	O
came	O
back	O
normal	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
spike	O
in	O
something	O
with	O
my	O
liver	O
which	O
was	O
normal	O
before.	O
My	O
Cholesterol	O
was	O
LDL	O
95	O
HDL	O
109	O
(which	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
is	O
advertised	O
to	O
raise?)	O
and	O
my	O
triglycerides	O
were	O
great	O
as	O
well.	O
I	O
can't	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
doesn't	O
work	O
but	O
compared	O
to	O
how	O
I	O
feel	O
it's	O
not	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
I'll	O
never	O
take	O
it	O
again.	O
I've	O
been	O
off	O
it	O
for	O
3	O
days	O
now	O
and	O
only	O
feel	O
slightly	O
bett.	O

I	O
took	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
one	O
month.	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
severe	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs.	O
After	O
I	O
quit	O
taking	O
it,	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
muscle	B-ADR
weakness	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
and	O
pain	B-ADR
when	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
sit	I-ADR
down	I-ADR
or	I-ADR
stand	I-ADR
from	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
sitting	I-ADR
position.	O
My	O
doctor	O
doesn't	O
seem	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
about	O
it.	O
I	O
am	O
scheduled	O
to	O
see	O
another	O
doctor	O
next	O
month.	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
20	O
mg	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O
Everyone	O
I	O
talk	O
to	O
who	O
is	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
says	O
they	O
have	O
leg	B-Finding
pain.	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
ever	O
take	O
another	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
tablet.	O

After	O
three	O
months	O
on	O
Lipitor,	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
feel	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
an	I-ADR
airhead	I-ADR
--	O
slightly	B-ADR
dizzy	I-ADR
virtually	I-ADR
all	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
time	I-ADR
and	O
frequently	B-ADR
unable	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
think	I-ADR
clearly.	O
I	O
actually	O
started	O
to	O
wonder	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
developing	O
early	O
Alzheimer's	B-Finding
(I'm	O
58).	O
After	O
five	O
months,	O
I	O
developed	O
severe	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
thighs	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
knees	I-ADR
and	O
I'm	O
exhausted	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
time.	O
So	O
far	O
my	O
blood	O
tests	O
have	O
been	O
normal,	O
but	O
now	O
that	O
I've	O
read	O
these	O
posts,	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	O
It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
total	O
cholesterol	O
from	O
235	O
to	O
200.	O

extreme	B-ADR
joint	I-ADR
pain.	O
First	O
started	O
as	O
a	O
stiff	B-ADR
neck.	O
That	O
went	O
away,	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
knee.	O
The	O
pain	O
has	O
since	O
radiated	O
to	O
wrists	O
and	O
hips.	O
I	O
felt	O
general	B-ADR
malaise	I-ADR
and	O
depression.	O
When	O
shopping,	O
I	O
needed	O
a	O
cart	O
for	O
support.	O
This	O
is	O
very	O
unlike	O
me.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
this	O
drug	O
for	O
almost	O
3	O
years.	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
tolerance	O
to	O
pain,	O
so	O
I	O
hesitated	O
to	O
call	O
my	O
doctor	O
thinking	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
would	O
go	O
away.	O
When	O
I	O
did	O
call,	O
his	O
advice,	O
get	O
off	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
!	O
I	O
was	O
glad	O
to	O
find	O
this	O
site	O
to	O
compare	O
my	O
side	O

with	O
others.	O

me!	O
I	O
will	O
never	O

again!	O
My	O
gastrc	O

put	O
the	O

on	O
this	O

I	O
was	O

48	O
and	O
ate	O
an	O
excellent	O
diet.	O
It	O
did	O
help	O
my	O

but	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
side	O
effects	O
was	O
not	O
taken	O
very	O
seriously.	O
It	O
can	O

post	O
operatively	O
I	O
suffered	O

I	O

weighing	O
four	O

At	O
the	O

I	O
didn't	O
experience	O
any	O
side	O
effects	O
at	O
all	O
on	O
10	O
mg.	O
It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O

In	O
my	O
2nd	O
year	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
very	O
bad	O
leg	B-ADR

in	O
the	O

when	O

In	O
the	O

my	O

to	I-ADR
go	I-ADR
up	I-ADR
which	O
I	O

for	O

In	O

I	O
have	O

as	O

as	O

all	O
the	O

When	O
I	O

I	O

that	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
side	O

I	O

from	O
taking	O

for	O
a	O

I	O
have	O
now	O
decided	O
to	O

before	O
something	O

to	O
me.	O
Too	O

all	O

Was	O
on	O

10	O

about	O
5	O

and	O
experienced	O
chronic	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
acute	I-ADR
back	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
which	O
gradually	O
improved	O
but	O
seemed	O
strange	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
I	O
hadn't	O
really	O
done	O
anything	O
to	O
strain	O
my	O
back	O

New	O
doc	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O

I	O
had	O

so	O
he	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Baycol.	O
Baycol	B-Drug
was	O
removed	O
from	O

so	O
next	O

put	O
me	O
back	O
on	O
Lipitor.	O
My	O

level	O
increased	O
to	O
slightly	O
over	O
200	O
so	O
my	O

increased	O

I	O

(over	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
in	O
1996	O
after	O
other	O

failed	O
to	O
have	O

I	O
have	O
taken	O
two	O

over	O
the	O

ten	O

and	O
was	O
told	O
I	O
had	O
a	O

with	O
no	O

I	O
am	O
6'	O
tall,	O
weighed	O
177	O

and	O
considered	O
myself	O
healthy	O
until	O

I	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
pass	O
a	O
physical	O
readiness	O
test,	O
including	O
a	O
1.5	O
mile	O
run,	O
every	O
6	O
months	O
because	O
I'm	O
in	O
the	O
military.	O
I	O
took	O
myself	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
because	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
take	O
the	O
physical	O
readiness	O
test.	O
In	O
fact	O
I	O
need	O
a	O

the	O

to	O

out	O

I	O

I	O
was	O

to	O

more	O
but	O
that	O
has	O
not	O
helped	O
my	O

which	O
have	O
continued	O
to	O
worsen.	O
Until	O
recently	O
I	O
walked	O
to	O

4	O

5	O
miles	O
most	O

and	O
more	O

I	O
also	O
ran	O
2	O

3	O

Now	O
I	O

my	I-ADR

and	O
I've	O
gained	O
10	O

I've	O

Two	O

my	O

a	O

and	O
I'm	O
looking	O

I	O
think	O
my	O

are	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O

Will	O
not	O

right	O
hip	O
and	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
over	O
3	O
weeks.	O
I'm	O
a	O
physician	O
and	O
initially	O
figured	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
sports	O
related	O
(although	O
being	O
right	O
handed,	O
I	O
was	O
suspicious	O
about	O
the	O
unilateral	O
left	O
shoulder	B-ADR
pain).	O
I	O
stuck	O
it	O
out	O
for	O
3	O
weeks	O
until	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
significant	B-ADR
limp.	O
Then	O
stopped	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
3	O
days	O
ago	O
and	O
noticed	O
a	O
very	O
significant	O
mitigation	O
of	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
-	O
about	O
80%	O
resolved	O
already.	O
The	O
drug	O
worked	O
wonders	O
on	O
cholesterol	O
(down	O
80	O
in	O
4	O
months),	O
but	O
I'll	O
be	O
starting	O
an	O
alternative	O
shortly.	O

Nothing	O
unusual	O
or	O
that	O
Im	O
aware	O
of	O
.	O
I	O
have	O
some	O
acid	B-Symptom

thats	O
developed	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
years,	O
which	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
related	O
since	O
it	O
runs	O
in	O
the	O

Works	O
great!	O
Hard	O
to	O
function	O
without	O
(pain),when	O
I	O
ran	O
out.	O
Im	O
probably	O
addicted	O
to	O
it.	O
Somewhat	O
concerned	O
about	O
the	O
long	O
term	O
effects	O
and	O
listed	O
possible	O
side	O
effects,	O
so	O
I've	O
only	O
ever	O
taken	O
arthrotec	B-Drug
50	I-Drug
once	O
daily	O
rather	O
than	O
twice,	O
which	O
is	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
manage	O
my	O
pain	B-Symptom
levels.	O
I	O
feel	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
cummulative	O
effect.	O
maybe.	O
I	O
dont	O
think	O
anything	O
will	O
completely	O
remove	O
the	O
pain,	O
and	O
maybe	O
shouldnt	O
since	O
it	O
helps	O
you	O
to	O
know	O
whats	O
going	O
on.	O
Else	O
how	O
much	O
would	O
you	O
have	O

within	O

are	O
pretty	O

how	O
I	O
felt	O
when	O
I	O
was	O

The	O
thing	O
is,	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
zoloft	B-Drug
today,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
months	O
before	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
months	O
to	O

when	O
I	O
restarted	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
put	O
me	O
in	O
that	O
state	O
in	O
a	O
could	O
of	O
weeks,	O
and	O
after	O
stopping	O
lipitor,	O
I	O
was	O
feeling	O
better	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days.	O
Just	O
to	O
be	O
sure,	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
lipitor	B-Drug
a	O
second	O
time,	O
and	O
the	O
depression	B-ADR
came	O
back	O
within	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
days.	O
It's	O
now	O
a	O
week	O
since	O
I	O
stopped	O
it	O
and	O
I'm	O
just	O
now	O
getting	O
back	O
to	O
normal.	O
I	O
haven't	O
noticed	O
any	O
increased	O
muscle	B-Finding
or	I-Finding
joint	B-Finding
pain.	O
I'm	O
not	O
touching	O
statins	O
again.	O

Started	O
experiencing	O
pain	B-Symptom
in	I-Symptom
my	I-Symptom
right	I-Symptom
heel	I-Symptom
when	O
walking	O
in	O
mid-November;	O
it	O
got	O
worse	O
over	O
time	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
orthopedist	O
in	O
early	O
December	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
had	O
plantar	B-Disease
fasciitis;	O
he	O
showed	O
me	O
stretching	O
exercises	O
and	O
advised	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
inserts	O
for	O
my	O
walking	O
shoes,	O
wear	O
cushioned	O
house	O
slippers	O
and	O
avoid	O
walking	O
up	O
inclines.	O
The	O
pain	B-Symptom
lessened	O
by	O
following	O
all	O
these	O
recommendations	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
uncomfortable	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
time.	O
I	O
finally	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
orthopedist	O
in	O
March	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
my	O
foot	O
"can"	O
improve	O
if	O
I	O
continued	O
with	O
the	O
exercises,	O
etc	O
At	O
the	O
very	O
end,	O
he	O
asked	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
the	O
"patch"	O
at	O
my	O
first	O
appointment;	O
so	O
I	O
left	O
with	O
a	O
sample	O
and	O
a	O
prescription	O
for	O
the	O
Flector	B-Drug
patch.	O
I	O
cut	O
a	O
patch	O
(there	O
are	O
five	O
in	O
each	O
reclosable	O
pouch)	O
in	O
half	O
and	O
it	O
covers	O
the	O
heel	O
area.	O
After	O
I	O
used	O
it	O
the	O
first	O
time,	O
the	O
puffiness	B-Symptom
and	O
pain	B-Symptom
were	O
gone!	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
best	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
patch	O
at	O
night	O
only	O
although	O
you	O
can	O
replace	O
it	O
every	O
12	O
hours.	O
I	O
put	O
the	O
patch	O
on	O
at	O
bedtime,	O
tape	O
the	O
edges	O
down	O
and	O
wear	O
a	O
sock	O
to	O
secure	O
it.	O
Initially,	O
I	O
used	O
it	O
every	O
night	O
and	O
after	O
about	O
three	O
weeks,	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
to	O
several	O
times	O
a	O
week.	O
It	O
certainly	O
helped	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
past	O
month	O
more	O
comfortable.	O

Has	O
been	O
all	O
OK	O
until	O
recently	O
when	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
get	O
"	B-ADR
fluey"	I-ADR
feelings	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
upper	I-ADR
arms,	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
etc	O
As	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
recently	O
had	O
flu	B-Drug
jab	I-Drug
thought	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
cause.	O
However	O
the	O
symptoms	O
persisted,	O
GP	O
said	O
"	O
just	O
flu	B-Drug
jab"	O
-	O
but	O
after	O
4	O
weeks!	O
Noticed	O
today	O
after	O
leaving	O
Artrotec	B-Drug
off	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
so	O
,that	O
things	O
were	O
much	O
better	O
until	O
I	O
took	O
one	O
dose.	O
fluey	B-ADR
feelings	I-ADR
returned	O
within	O
a	O
hour.	O
Draw	O
your	O
own	O
conclusions.	O

severe	B-ADR
nausea	I-ADR
dizziness	B-ADR
terrible	B-ADR
stomach	I-ADR
pain.	O

First	O
of	O
all,	O
I	O
noticed	O
severe	B-ADR
lower	I-ADR
back	I-ADR
pain.	O
I	O
put	O
this	O
off	O
as	O
a	O
work-out	O
related	O
pain.	O
After	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
intensified	O
after	O
it	O
should	O
have	O
gone	O
away,	O
I	O
became	O
concerned.	O
Then	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
my	O
knee	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
right	I-ADR
hip	B-ADR
hurt.	O
Then	O
I	O
started	O
crying	B-ADR
for	I-ADR
no	I-ADR
reason.	O
I	O
yelled	O
at	O
my	O
poor	O
dog	O
for	O
doing	O
nothing.	O
ALl	O
in	O
all,	O
this	O
drug	O
really	O
sucks.	O
I	O
hate	O
it.	O
I	O
hate	O
the	O
doctor	O
that	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
it.	O
I	O
can't	O
wait	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
of	O
it.	O
I	O
shouldn't	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place.	O
I	O
swear	O
she	O
must	O
be	O
doing	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
drug	O
compant	O
kick	O
backs.	O

The	O
very	O
first	O
day	O
I	O
took	O
20	O
mg	O
of	O
lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
experienced	O
a	O
severe	B-ADR
headache	I-ADR
and	O
neck	B-ADR
pain.	O
I	O
felt	O
light	B-ADR
headed	I-ADR
and	O
shaky.	O
By	O
the	O
fifth	O
day	O
I	O
felt	B-ADR
flu-like	I-ADR
and	O
very	O
sick.	O
The	O
headache	B-ADR
was	O
constant	O
and	O
only	O
Aleve	B-Drug
slightly	O
helped	O
it.	O
I	O
would	O
sit	O
with	O
a	O
heating	O
pad	O
for	O
hours	O
on	O
my	O
neck.	O
On	O
day	O
6	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
lipitor.	O
This	O
is	O
my	O
3rd	O
day	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
and	O
I	O
feel	O
90%	O
better.	O
I	O
only	O
had	O
a	O
slight	O
headache	B-ADR
and	O
shouldar	B-ADR
ache	I-ADR
today.	O
There	O
are	O
sooo	O
many	O
people	O
that	O
take	O
liptior	B-Drug
and	O
never	O
have	O
a	O
side	O
effect	O
and	O
they	O
achieve	O
wonderful	O
results.	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
take	O
it	O
again.	O
Now	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
about	O
lowering	O
my	O
cholesterol.	O
I	O
really	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
another	O
drug.	O
I	O
know	O
my	O
doctor	O
will	O
laugh	O
at	O
natural	O
remedies	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it,	O
but	O
I	O
will	O
try.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
muscle/joint	B-ADR
pain,	O
mainly	O
in	O
my	O
arms	B-ADR
which	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
painful	I-ADR
when	O
I	O
position	O
them	O
in	O
certain	O
ways;	O
otherwise	O
I	O
am	O
just.	O
This	O
works	O
for	O
lowering	O
Cholesterol,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
sure	O
about	O
the	O
big	O
picture.	O
I	O
hesitated	O
going	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
now	O
believe	O
my	O
original	O
impression	O
was	O
probably	O
correct.	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
try	O
something	O
natural	O
instead.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
isn't	O
worth	O
it.	O

With	O
this	O
one	O
it	O
just	O
makes	O
me	O
a	O
little	O
drowsy!.	O

This	O
medicine	O
completely	O
relieves	O
my	O
thumb	B-Symptom
pain,	O
and	O
really	O
helps	O
with	O
my	O
back	B-Symptom
pain.	O
BUT,	O
it	O
makes	O
my	O
stomach	B-ADR
hurt	I-ADR
soooo	I-ADR
bad	I-ADR
that	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
what	O
is	O
worse.	O
I	O
only	O
use	O
it	O
when	O
my	O
thumbs	B-Symptom
hurt	I-Symptom
so	I-Symptom
bad	I-Symptom
I	O
want	O
to	O
cry.	O
Then	O
I	O
put	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain.	O
It	O
also	O
give	O
you	O
diarrhea	B-ADR
but	O
I	O
can	O
handle	O
that.	O

Heavy,	O
extended	B-ADR
bleeding	I-ADR
during	I-ADR
menstruation.	O
works	O
good	O
on	O
back	B-Symptom
pain.	O

Very	O
effective.	O
Lowered	O
cholesterol	O
from	O
230	O
to	O
160.	O

After	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
2	O
1/2	O
years,	O
I	O
experienced	O
problems	O
pronouncing.	O

I	O
started	O

these	O
symptoms	O
to	O
a	O
lesser	O
degree	O
two	O
weeks	O
before	O
I	O
started	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
due	O
to	O
a	O
viral	B-Finding
upper	I-Finding

infection.	O
These	O
symptoms	O
increased	O
with	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
lessened	O
when	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
it.	O
Wondering	O
if	O
metabolic	O
changes	O
battling	O
high	B-Finding

is	O
the	O
cause	O
rather	O
than	O
the	O

itself.	O
I	O
will	O
try	O
taking	O
Co-Enzyme	B-Drug
Q	I-Drug
to	O

I	O
also	O
take	O
Zinc	B-Drug

(which	O
lowers	O

Problems	B-ADR

I	I-ADR
had	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

much	O
of	O
the	O
time.	O
Irritable.	O
I	O
had	O
no	O

for	O
about	O
6	O
months.	O
Since	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
medication	O
I	O
was	O
taking,	O
I	O
quit	O
it	O
and	O
started	O
feeling	O
better	O
within	O
a	O
week.	O
It	O
took	O
about	O
3-4	O
weeks	O
to	O
completely	O
recover	O
from	O
this	O
medicine	O
.	O
I	O
tried	O
other	O
statins,	O
but	O
had	O
similar	O
bad	O
side	O
effects.	O

After	O
a	O
mild	O
heart	B-Disease
attack	I-Disease
2	O
years	O
ago	O
I	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
10mg	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
began	O
having	O
leg	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
feet	I-ADR
cramps.	O
I	O
stopped	O
for	O
a	O
month	O
and	O
felt	O
better	O
but	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
went	O
back	O
up.	O
The	O
doctor	O
insisted	O
I	O
go	O
back	O
on.	O
When	O
I	O
complained	O
of	O
feet	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
leg	I-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
the	O
doctor	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
5	O
mg.	O
This	O
helped	O
but	O
after	O
3	O
months	O
my	O
feet	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
and	O
I	O
wake	O
several	O

I	O

I	O
am	O
going	O

It	O
is	O

through	O
the	O

The	O

does	O
not	O
believe	O
it	O

the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug

I	O
feel	O

it	O

When	O

It	O
doesn't	O

I	O
always	O

This	O

Since	O
my	O

out	O

I've	O
only	O

on	O

(10mg),	O
I'm	O

I	O

I've	O
also	O
had	O

that	O
any	O

you	O
go	O
in	O
for	O
a	O

it	O
could	O
be	O
very	O
different.	O
It's	O
just	O
that	O
my	O
last	O
one	O
was	O
high	O
(275!)	O
But	O
sometimes	O
it's	O
170.	O
And	O
it's	O
also	O
been	O
borderline	O
for	O
many	O
years,	O
around	O
200.	O
(with	O
the	O
good	O
cholesterol	O
very	O
good).	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
higher	O
these	O
days,	O
because	O
I've	O
been	O
in	O
menopause	B-Finding
longer.	O
But	O
I	O
wonder	O
if	O

the	O

On	O
10	O

didnt	O
seem	O
to	O

and	O
my	O

went	O
from	O
256	O

190	O
in	O
30	O

was	O

but	O
then	O
after	O
another	O

my	O
cholestrol	O
went	O
back	O
up	O
to	O
235	O
and	O
my	O
doctor	O
decided	O
to	O
bump	O
up	O
my	O
dose	O
to	O
20	O
mg.	O
thats	O
when	O
the	O
severe	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
started	O
and	O
very	O
debillitating-I	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
rheumotogologist	O
thinking	O
it	O
was	O
lupus	B-Finding
or	O
fibromalgyia	B-Finding
as	O
i	B-ADR
felt	I-ADR
like	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
always	I-ADR
had	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
flu	I-ADR
and	O
she	O
took	O
a	O
blood	O

and	O
said	O
I	O
had	O
muscle	B-ADR
damage	I-ADR
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
Do	O
the	O
benefits	O
outweigh	O
the	O
severe	O
side	O
effects-Pfizer	O
says	O
it's	O
rare	O
but	O
serious	O
side	O
effects-I	O
know	O
many	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
problem	O
with	O
muscle	B-Finding
damage	I-Finding
so	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
consider	O
the	O
side	O
effect	O
to	O
be	O
rare	O
and	O
now	O
since	O
I'm	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
wonder	O
how	O
much	O
permanent	B-ADR
damage	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
muscles	I-ADR
is	O
their	O
due	O
to	O
this	O
awful	O

I	O
didn't	O
think	O
I	O
had	O
any	O

the	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
the	O
over	O

I	O

almost	O
immediately.	O
At	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
the	O

However	O
I	O
did	O
consider	O
the	O
side	O

I	O
read	O
in	O

I	O
stopped	O

for	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
felt	O
somewhat	O
better,	O
Christmas	O
over	O
by	O
then,	O
once	O
again	O
I	O
considered	O
stress	B-Finding
as	O
the	O
cause	O
and	O
not	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
about	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
and	O
feel	O
horrible	O
again.	O
Found	O
this	O

and	O
no	O

the	O
source	O
of	O

is	O
definitely	O
from	O

I	O

this	O

I	O

a	O

Severe	B-ADR

Within	O
a	O
week	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
taking	O
the	O
prescribe	O
dose,	O
I	O
began	O
developing	O
something	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
before:	O
eczema.	O
It	O
became	O
progressively	O
worse,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
month	O
had	O
created	O
a	O
massive	B-ADR
triangular	I-ADR
rash	I-ADR
on	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
forehead,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
a	O
patch	B-ADR
on	I-ADR
one	I-ADR
cheek.	O
The	O
skin	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
red	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
rough,	O
and	O
made	O
public	O
life	O
miserable	O
and	O
embarassing.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
the	O
rash	B-ADR
cleared	O
up	O
greatly,	O
but	O
has	O
NEVER	O
gone	O
away	O
completly,	O
flaring	O
up	O
slightly	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time,	O
but	O
not	O
nearly	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
during	O

with	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
taking	O
any	O

medications	O
at	O
the	O
time,	O
and	O
never	O
had	O
eczema	B-ADR
before.	O
The	O
anti-lipid	O
effect	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
unusually	O
strong	O
in	O
my	O
case,	O
causing	O
my	O
CHO	O
to	O
drop	O
below	O
90	O
(from	O
a	O
baseline	O
of	O
over	O
200).	O
by	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
2	O
weeks	O
of	O
dosing,	O
my	O
physician	O
had	O
me	O
cutting	O

half	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
once	O
a	O

Even	O
so,	O
the	O
rash	B-ADR
continued	O
to	O
enlarge	O
and	O
get	O
worse,	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O

I	O
would	O

as	O
I	O

it	O

considerably.	O

though	O
statistically	O
(anecdotally)I	O
am	O
part	O

if	O

if	O

I	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
this	O

by	O
my	O

for	O
my	O
somewhat	O
high	B-Finding

The	O
next	O
day,	O
after	O

this	O

I	O
suddenly	O
felt	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
had	I-ADR
aged	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
eighty	I-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
overnight	I-ADR
but	O
did	O
not	O
connect	O
it	O
to	O
starting	O
Lipitor.	O
Up	O
until	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
this	O
drug	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
young	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
my	O
twenties	O
and	O
wondered	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
how	O
you	O
might	O
start	O
feeling	O
the	O
affects	O
of	O
age,	O
by	O
waking	O
up	O
one	O
morning	O
and	O
feeling	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
that	I-ADR
age	I-ADR
caught	I-ADR
up	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
you	I-ADR
and	O
now	O
you	O
were	O
older	O
than	O
your	O
years.	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
two	O
terrible	O
months	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
and	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
had	O
dropped.	O
My	O
doctor	O
mailed	O
me	O
the	O
results	O
of	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O
new	O
prescription	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
refilled.	O
So	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
within	O
two	O
months	O
I	O
was	O
feeling	O
normal	O
again	O
and	O
even	O
took	O
a	O
job	O
with	O
the	O
post	O
office	O
where	O
I	O
walked	O
five	O
miles	O
a	O
day	O
with	O
no	O
problem.	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
associate	O
my	O
getting	O
better	O
with	O
my	O
coming	O
off	O
Lipitor,	O
unfortunately.	O
Then	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
appointment	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O
prescription	O
by	O
calling	O
his	O
office.	O
So	O
I	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day,	O
after	O
taking	O
only	O
one	O
pill,	O
I	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
eighty	I-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
again.	O
This	O
time	O
I	O
did	O
associate	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
then	O
read	O
the	O
warnings	O
the	O
drug	O
store	O
gives	O
you	O
with	O
meds	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
were	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
what	O
they	O
warned	O
against.	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
hypochondriac	B-Finding
and	O
I	O
never	O
read	O
those	O
warnings	O
so	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
head	O
thing.	O
I	O
immediately	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
but	O
a	O
year	O
later	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
eighty	B-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
feeling	I-ADR
and	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
ever	O
be	O
normal	O
again.	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
how	O
just	O
one	O
pill	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
and	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
recovering	O
like	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
first	O
time.	O
This	O
has	O
ruined	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
taken	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
if	O
I	O
knew	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
now	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
sorry	O
that	O
I	O
ever	O
heard	O
of	O
this	O
drug.	O
This	O
is	O
so	O
severe	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
even	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
can	O
cause	O
permanent	O
damage.	O
My	O
doctor,	O
when	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
of	O
all	O
this,	O
wanted	O
to	O
change	O
statins	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
worried	O
about	O
my	O
cholesterol.	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
no	O
more	O
statins	O
and	O
he	O
then	O
prescribed	O
Zetia,	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
was	O
less	O
effective	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
statin,	O
which	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
afraid	O
to	O
take	O
unless	O
I	O
improve	O
from	O
the	O
affects	O
of	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
He	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
himself	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
problems	O
but	O
then	O
said,	O
well	O
he	O
did	O
have	O
neck	B-Finding
pains	I-Finding
that	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
side	O
affect,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
the	O
drug	O
two	O
years	O
before	O
this	O
developed.	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
information	O
on	O
this	O
site	O
that	O
describes	O
some	O
people	O
having	O
that	O

I	O
advised	O
him	O
to	O
take	O
himself	O
off	O

this	O

for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
to	O

years	O
(had	O
been	O
on	O

a	O
couple	O
of	O

I	O
began	O
experiencing	O

that	O
is	O
now	O
so	O

that	O
I	O

if	O
it's	O

I'm	O
very	O

The	O
pain	B-ADR
is	O
often	O

that	O
it	O
limits	B-ADR

recently,	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
a	O

all	O
over	O
my	O

It	O
scares	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O

it's	O
very	O
dangerous	O
stuff.	O

lethargy	B-ADR

After	O

At	O

any	O

until	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
after	O
start	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
experienced	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

sometimes	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
even	O
walk	O
in	O
the	O

my	O
muscles	B-ADR
were	I-ADR
very	I-ADR

After	O
consulting	O
with	O
my	O

he	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O

until	O
the	O

the	O

when	O
I	O

I	O
went	O

I	O
took	O
off	O

during	O

I	O
tried	O

the	O

did	O
not	O

I	O
decided	O
to	O

the	O

Doctors	O
unable	O
to	O
connect	O
the	O

(Lipitor	O
=	O
above	O
symptoms).	O
Sure	O
it	O
lowered	O
my	O

But	O
at	O
what	O
cost?	O
I	O
told	O
my	O
doctor	O
I	O
was	O
feeling	B-ADR
weak.	O
He	O
commented	O
I	O
see	O
NO	O
reason	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
be	O
weak	B-ADR
(Even	O
though	O
he	O
prescribed	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
me)	O
Well	O
needless	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
saw	O
him.	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
MS,Lupus,Fibromyalgia	O
or	O
some	O
other	O
illness	O
that	O
has	O
the	O
symptoms	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing.	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
could	O
be	O
the	O
reason	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
symptoms.	O
So,	O
on	O
my	O
own,	O
I	O
stopped	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(I	O
was	O
only	O
on	O
10mg	O
per	O
day)	O
Within	O
48	O
hours	O
I	O
felt	O
my	O
mood	O
elevating	O
back	O
to	O
normal.	O
So	O
far	O
(I've	O
been	O
off	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
5	O
days	O
now),	O
my	O
chest	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
has	O
improved	O
by	O
about	O
75%.	O
This	O
is	O
no	O
coincidence	O
I	O
am	O
certain.	O
Hopefully	O
my	O
other	O
symptoms	O
of	O
fatigue,	O
anxiety,	O
memory	B-ADR
and	O
insomnia	B-ADR
will	O
alleviate	O
as	O
well.	O
By	O
the	O
way.	O
my	O
new	O
doctor	O
had	O
prescribed	O
an	O
anti-depressent	O
for	O
me.	O
I	O
never	O
filled	O
it,	O
as	O
my	O

me	O
it	O
was	O
something	O
more.	O
I	O

my	I-ADR

I	O

flatulence,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
rarely	O
suffered	O
from	O
before	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
developed	O

and	O
even	O
after	O

and	O
correcting	O
the	O

they	O
did	O
not	O
go	O

After	O
a	O
year	O
of	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
my	O
urine	B-ADR
started	I-ADR
feeling	I-ADR
as	I-ADR
if	I-ADR
it	I-ADR
was	I-ADR

when	O
it	O
touched	O
my	O
skin	O
and	O
I	O
developed	O
a	O
rash	B-ADR
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
rid	O
of.	O
About	O
a	O
month	O
ago,	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
get	O
muscle	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
that	O
made	O
it	O
difficult	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
from	O
a	O

I	O
have	O
also	O

tremendous	B-ADR

After	O
two	O
weeks	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
my	O

and	O
the	O

are	O
gone.	O
The	O
weakness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

seems	O
to	O
have	O
diminished	O
somewhat	O
in	O
the	O

so,	O
making	O
it	O

to	O

My	O
neck	O
is	O
still	O
a	O

and	O
has	O
not	O

I	O
am	O

that	O
it	O
will	O

over	O

I	O

I	O

and	O
the	O
lower	B-ADR

in	O
the	O

Then	O
I	O
started	O

after	O
one	O

and	O
the	O
lower	B-ADR

I	O
took	O

for	O

I	O

After	O

I	O

my	O

Within	O

The	O

I	O

I	O

due	O

for	O
a	O
period	O

At	O
that	O
point,	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
terrible,	B-ADR
migratory	I-ADR
joint	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
all	I-ADR
over	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
body	I-ADR
that	O
was	O
very	O
distinct	O
and	O
pronounced.	O
I	O
also	O
had	O
disabling	B-ADR
fatigue	I-ADR
and	O
flu-like	B-ADR
malaise.	O
Some	O
nights	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
to	O

at	O
6	O

and	O
not	O
get	O
up	O
until	O
8	O
or	O
9	O
the	O
next	O

I	O
was	O
quite	B-ADR
ill.	O
My	O
doctor	O
did	O
tons	O
of	O
lab	O
work	O
to	O
rule	O
out	O
things	O
like	O
rheumatoid	B-Finding
arthriitis,	O

and	O
active	B-Finding

These	O
all	O
came	O
back	O
NEGATIVE.	O
Finally,	O
I	O
was	O
taken	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
drug	O
had	O
anything	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
my	O
symptoms.	O
Within	O
72	O
hours	O
I	O
noted	O
an	O
improvement;	O
within	O
seven	O
days,	O
the	O
symptoms	O
were	O
completely	O
gone	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
restored	O
to	O
health.	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
ever	O
take	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
again	O
as	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
liver-toxic	O
and	O
slowly	O
poisons	O
the	O
patient.	O
It	O
did	O
a	O
great	O
job	O
of	O
lowering	O
my	O
LDL	O
(173	O
down	O
to	O
60).	O
My	O
total	O
cholesterol	O
went	O
from	O
238	O
down	O
to	O
143.	O
However,	O
it	O
nearly	O
killed	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
almost	O
like	O
a	O
slow-acting	O
poison.	O

NOT	O
YET.	O

Daily	O
headaches.	O
I	O
also	O
started	O
on	O
hormones	O
and	O
thought	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
causing	O
them	O
but	O
as	O
I'm	O
reading	O
this	O
I'm	O
thinking	O
it's	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
haven't	O
been	O
on	O
it	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
reduces	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
but	O
even	O
if	O
it	O
does	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
I'll	O
continue	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
if	O
the	O
headaches	B-ADR
don't	O
go	O
away.	O

Tastes	O
gross	O
--	O
heavy	O
mint	O
flavor.	O
Felt	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
burning	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
esophagus	I-ADR
all	O
the	O
way	O
down,	O
then	O
dry	B-ADR
heaves	I-ADR
once	O
it	O
hit	O
my	O
stomach.	O
But	O
it	O
didn't	O
make	O
me	O
actually	O
vomit,	O
and	O
the	O
burning	B-ADR
sensation	I-ADR
went	O
away	O
quickly.	O
Was	O
prescribed	O
Cambia	B-Drug
as	O
a	O
backup	O
to	O
Maxalt,	O
since	O
triptans	B-Drug
can	O
be	O
taken	O
only	O
2	O
days/week.	O
Unfortunately,	O
it	O
didn't	O
work	O
at	O
all	O
on	O
my	O
migraines,	O
so	O
I'll	O
continue	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
something	O
else	O
as	O
a	O
backup.	O

My	O
God,this	O

is	O
great!	O
Used	O
on	O
my	O
extremely	O

and	O
within	O
minutes	O
felt	O
relief.	O
(I	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
Advil	B-Drug
I	O
had	O
taken	O
earlier	O
kicking	O
in)	O
However,	O
several	O
days	O
later,had	O
a	O
flare	O
with	O
joint	B-Symptom
pain	I-Symptom
in	I-Symptom
wrist.	O
Squeezed	O
out	O
a	O
few	O
drops	O
and	O
rubbed	O
it	O
in	O
and	O
pain	B-Symptom
relief	O
was	O
almost	O
immediate.	O
I	O
read	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
prescribed	O
for	O
knee	B-Finding
pain	I-Finding
but	O
my	O
doctor	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
sample	O
because	O
the	O
voltaren	B-Drug
has	O
worked	O
ok	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
can't	O
take	O
Advil	B-Drug
a	O
lot	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
gastro	B-Finding
effects.	O
Boy,I	O
love	O

After	O

for	O

two	O

I	O

in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

I	O
was	O

severe	B-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

The	O
good	O
news	O
was	O
that	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
dropped	O
from	O
269	O
to	O
160.	O
The	O
bad	O
news	O
was	O
that	O
long	O
term,	O
it	O
would	O
likely	O
impact	O
the	O

Once	O
the	O

saw	O
the	O

test,	O
he	O
called	O
(himself)	O
and	O
said	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
immediately.	O
Interestingly,	O
Niaspan	B-Drug
had	O
the	O

effect.	O
I'm	O

taking,	O
&	O
they	O
say	O
no	O
systemic	O
effects	O
from	O
the	O
topical	O
gel,	O
but	O
I've	O
gone	O
on	O
&	O
off	O
it	O
4	O
or	O
5	O
times	O
now	O
and	O
the	O
effects	O
when	O

are	O
unmistakeable.	O

I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
in	O
December	O
2009	O
and	O
stopped	O
after	O
4	O
months.	O
During	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
both	I-ADR
shoulders,	I-ADR
sometimes	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
neck	I-ADR
also,	O
causing	O
me	O
to	O
wake	O
several	O
times	O
each	O
night.	O
Pain	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
worse	I-ADR
in	O
the	O
morning	O
but	O
rarely	O
went	O
away	O
completely	O
during	O
the	O
day.	O
Most	O
mornings	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
wash	O
my	O
hair	O
in	O
the	O
shower	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
unable	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
reach	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
top	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
head	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
hands.	O
Pain	B-ADR
and	O
restricted	B-ADR
movement	I-ADR
often	O
prevented	O
me	O
from	O
putting	O
on	O
shoes	O
and	O
socks	O
without	O
assistance.	O
In	O
January	O
this	O
year	O
I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
discomfort	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
left	I-ADR
hand	I-ADR
for	O
the	O
first	O
time.	O
Now	O
in	O
both	O
hands,	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
has	O
increased,	O
fingers	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
swollen	I-ADR
and	O
movement	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
restricted.	O
My	O
wife	O
tells	O
me	O
my	O
hands	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
warm	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
touch.	O
The	O
mornings	O
are	O
worse	O
when	O
they	O
hurt	O
the	O
most,	O
movement	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
restricted	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
it	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
impossible	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
make	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
fist.	O
Ice	O
and	O
ibruprofen	B-Drug
gel	I-Drug
help	O
but	O
only	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
while.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
400	O
mg	O
Ibruprofen	B-Drug
3	O
times	O
daily	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
on	O
my	O
doctors	O
advice	O
without.	O
This	O
drug	O
is	O
clearly	O
POISON	O
to	O
so	O
many	O
people	O
and	O
perhaps	O
there	O
is	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
take	O
Pfizer	O
to	O
the	O
courts.	O
However	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
any	O
Doctor	O
prescribing	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
should	O
make	O
it	O
abundantly	O
clear	O
to	O
the	O
patient	O
that	O
very	O
serious	O
consequences	O
could	O
ensue	O
that	O
would	O
cause	O
extreme	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
could	O
effect	O
quality	O
of	O
life.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
failure	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
is	O
a	O
serious	O
deriliction	O
of	O
duty	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
tested	O
with	O
complaints	O
to	O
the	O
medical	O
authorities	O
that	O
oversee	O
our	O
doctors	O
and/or	O
the	O
courts.	O

Pain	B-ADR

about	O

The	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

interrupts	O
my	O

I	O
thought	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
just	O

and/or	O
out	O

but	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
the	O

I	O

going	O
off	O

and	O
trying	O
CoQ	B-Drug

I've	O

just	O

my	O

yesterday.	O
I'm	O

I've	O

to	O

the	O

My	O

is	O
in	O

agreement	O
and	O
has	O
recommeded	O
Zocor	B-Drug
once	O
my	O
side	O

from	O

disappear.	O
I've	O

My	O

hurt	I-ADR
in	O
the	O
morning	O

up,	O

the	O

once	O
I	O

off	O
lipitor	B-Drug
now.	O
6	O
months	O
post	O
lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
am	O
still	O
experiencing	O
periodic	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
&	O
I	O
wonder	O
will	O
I	O
ever	O
totally	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
way	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
be.	O
would	O
be	O
grateful	O
for	O
any	O

I	O
am	O
thankful	O
to	O
be	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
awful	O
muscle	B-ADR
spasms	I-ADR
I	O
experienced	O
whilst	O
taking	O
lipitor	B-Drug
&	O
would	O
advise	O
people	O
to	O
think	O
very	O
carefully	O
before	O
taking	O
this	O
drug.	O

I	O
have	O
taken	O
6	O
pills	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
(75mg	O
each),	O
but	O
the	O
side	O
effect	O
I	O
had	O
from	O
my	O
last	O
pill	O
was	O
awful.	O
It	O
induced	O
severe	B-ADR
vaginal	I-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
without	O
bleeding	O
about	O
2	O
hours	O
after	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
medication.	O
I	O
ended	O
up	O
having	O
to	O
take	O
additional	O
medication	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
(pamprin)	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
sleep.	O
Sat	O
on	O
the	O
bathroom	O
for	O
30	O
minutes.	O
If	O
I	O
knew	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
went	O
to	O
bed	O
with	O
a	O
sore	B-Symptom
knee	I-Symptom
instead	O
-	O
it	O
hurt	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
cramps.	O
This	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
anti-inflammatory	O
drug	O
that	O
helps	O
for	O
my	O
knee	B-Symptom
pain/inflammation	I-Symptom
and	O
its	O
reliable	O
in	O
that.	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
infrequently,	O
once	O
every	O
several	O
months	O
and	O
1	O
pill	O
is	O
often	O
enough	O
for	O
me.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
pleased	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
help	O
deal	O
with	O
my	O
back	B-Symptom
pain.	O
However.	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
six	O
months,	O
I	O
have	O
started	O
having	O
vaginal	B-ADR
bleeding	I-ADR
almost	O
every	O
day	O
of	O
the	O
month.	O
Lots	O
of	O
clotting,	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
horrible	I-ADR
periods.	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
obgyn	O
and	O
everything	O
came	O
out	O
normal.	O
The	O
doc	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
birth	B-Drug
control.	O
But,	O
the	O
bleeding	B-ADR
has	I-ADR
not	I-ADR
subsided.	O
So	O
now	O
I	O
am	O
scheduled	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
endometrial	O
biopsy	O
on	O
Wed.	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
ephiphany	O
last	O
night	O
about	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
and	O
began	O
researching	O
the	O
side	O
effect.	O
When	O
I	O
came	O
across	O
this	O
website,	O
I	O
was	O
appalled	O
that	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
females	O
mention	O
heavy/extra	B-ADR
vaginal	I-ADR
bleeding.	O
I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
answer	O
to	O
my	O
bleeding	B-ADR
problem	I-ADR
and	O
will	O
be	O
telling	O
the	O
doctor	O
on	O
Monday,.	O
Although	O
this	O
drug	O
has	O
helped	O
with	O
the	O
pain,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
cost	O
and	O
hassle	O
of	O
bleeding	B-ADR
constantly.,	O
On	O
top	O
of	O
that,	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
having	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
procedure	O
that	O
a	O
31	O
year	O
old	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
endure.	O
I	O
truly	O
hope	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
long	O
term	O
effects	O
from	O
this.	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
taken	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
in	O
almost	O
a	O
week,	O
yet	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
bleeding.	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
extra	B-Symptom
pains	I-Symptom
I	O
will	O
llkely	O
experience	O
in	O
a	O
couple	O
weeks,	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
I	O
can	O
find	O
something	O
else	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
them.	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
become	O
dependent	O
on	O
this	O
medicine	O
to	O
function.	O

Muscle	B-ADR
aches	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
pains.	O
Stiffness	B-ADR
of	I-ADR

When	O
I	O
sat	O
down	O
for	O
a	O
bit	O
and	O
then	O
stood	O
up,	O
I	O
couldn't	B-ADR
move	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs.	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
a	O
bit	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
moving.	O
Also	O
developed	O
plantar	B-ADR
fasciitis	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

I	O
couldn't	B-ADR
get	I-ADR
down	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
stairs	I-ADR
in	O
the	O
morning,	O
I	O
was	O
crawling.	O
I	O
had	O
cortison	B-Drug
shots	I-Drug
in	O
my	O
feet	O
(these	O
were	O
just	O
as	O
painful)	O
but	O
they	O
didn't	O
work.	O
Stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
I	O
haven't	O
felt	O
better.	O
I	O
noticed	O
a	O
difference	O
within	O
a	O
week.	O
These	O
drugs	O
are	O
poison	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O
the	O
market.	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
taking	O
CoQ10	B-Drug
with	O
Vitamin	B-Drug
E	I-Drug
to	O
try	O
and	O
heal	O
my	O
body.	O
From	O
all	O
the	O
reading	O
I	O
have	O
done,	O
the	O
doctor	O
should	O
have	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
this	O
because	O
the	O
statins	O
deplete	O
your	O
body	O
of	O
CoQ10.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
over	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
it	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
from	O
299	O
to	O
220,	O
but	O
I,	O
too,	O
have	O
been	O
having	O
side	O
effects,	O
I	O
guess	O
now,	O
that	O
might	O

Unable	B-ADR

He	O
diagnosed	O
it	O
as	O

Funny,	O
that	O
it	O
only	O
began	O
when	O
I	O
started	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
took	O
myself	O
off	O
it	O
4	O
months	O

My	O

about	O

After	O

I	O
experienced	O
extreme	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
loss	B-ADR
of	I-ADR

in	I-ADR
left	I-ADR

Advice	O
from	O
Cardiologist	O
was	O
to	O
immediately	O
stop	O
taking	O
Liptitor.	O
It	O
was	O
too	O
late,	O
resulting	O
in	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
work	O
and	O
ended	O
up	O
disabitlity	O
and	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
join	O
a	O
class	O
action	O
lawsuit	O
against	O
the	O
drug	O
company	O
responsible.	O
Would	O
like	O
to	O
hear	O
from	O
others	O
who	O
have	O
had	O
problems	O
with	O
this	O
drug.	O

None,	O
unless	O
too	O
much	O
is	O
taken	O
too	O
close	O
together,	O
then	O
it	O
can	O
cause	O
gassy	B-ADR
abdominal	I-ADR
cramping.	O
It	O
is	O
the	O
BEST	O
pain	B-Symptom
reliever	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
been	O
prescribed	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
do	O
without	O
it!	O
I	O
happen	O
to	O
have	O
Endometriosis	B-Disease
that	O
has	O
attached	O
to	O
"everything"	O
in	O
the	O
backside,	O
including	O
my	O
Sciatic	O
nerve.	O
Sciatic	B-Disease
Endo	I-Disease
is	O
rarely	O
seen,	O
but	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
in	O
me.	O
I	O
do	O
Restorative	O
Yoga	O
postures	O
to	O
get	O
myself	O
loosened	O
up	O
every	O
day,	O
but	O
keep	O
the	O
Cataflam	B-Drug
handy	O
as	O
nothing	O
works	O
better	O
for	O
the	O
pain,	O
unless	O
I	O
have	O
an	O
extremely	O
bad	O
time	O
where	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
Demerol	B-Drug
with	O
it	O
(rarely).	O
However,	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
in	O
the	O
"patient	O
info"	O
they	O
give	O
with	O
my	O
Rx	O
that	O
now	O
warnings	O

are	O
written	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
before	O
when	O
I	O
started	O
this	O
Rx.	O
The	O
best	O
dose	O
for	O
me	O
(per	O
my	O
doctor)	O
is	O
2	O
pills	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
your	O
system,	O
then	O
1	O
every	O
8	O
hours	O
afterward.	O
Luckily,	O
I	O
only	O
need	O
this	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
a	O

at	O
the	O

was	O

at	O
how	O

better	O
I	O
began	O
to	O

While	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
had	O

every	O
day.	O
I	O
was	O

and	O
could	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
20mg	O

for	O
1	O

It	O
has	O

did	O
help	O
to	O

but	O
after	O
1	O

of	O
using	O
it	O
i	O
have	O

experciencing	O
alot	O

At	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
fine,but	O
after	O
1	O

the	O

starts.	O
i	O
started	O
off	O
with	O
20mg	O
and	O
then	O
lower	O
it	O
to	O
20mg.	O

I	O
can't	O
say	O
these	O
were.	O
It	O
did	O
reduce	O
cholestoral,	O
but	O
seems	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
life	O
too.	O

After	O
taking	O

for	O
1	O

my	O

jumped	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
between	I-ADR

I	O

The	O

after	O

my	O

the	O

what	O

in	O
the	O

just	O
within	O
the	O
last	O

I've	O
been	O
experiencing	O
spasms	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
upper	I-ADR

Now	O
I	O
have	O
a	O

apptmt.	O
in	O
a	O
few	O

because	O
my	O

I	O
can't	O
even	O
bend	O

I	O
suffer	O

from	O

from	O
my	O

My	O

my	I-ADR

not	O

I	O
just	O
wish	O
the	O
doctors	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
about	O
the	O
side	O

to	O
expect.	O

Absolutely	O
none.	O
No	O

Worked	O

to	O
reduce	O
my	O

by	O
about	O
20%	O
within	O
just	O
a	O
few	O
weeks.	O
There's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
long-term	O
safety	O
data	O
with	O
this	O
class	O
of	O
drug	O
(statins)	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
I'll	O
keep	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
long-term	O
benefits.	O

I've	O
been	O
taking	O
Liptor	B-Drug
for	O
about	O
a	O
year	O
with	O
no	O
major	O
side	O

but	O
recently	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
experiencing	O
a	O
sore,	B-ADR
tingly	I-ADR
tongue(Glossitis)	I-ADR
and	O
have	O
ruled	O
out	O
everything	O
from	O

I	O
have	O
also	O
had	O
dizzy	B-ADR
spells,	O
headaches,	O
and	O
trouble	B-ADR
sleeping.	O
Doctor	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
discontinue	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
which	O
I	O
just	O
did	O
a	O
couple	O
days	O
ago	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
know	O
in	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
so	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
cause	O
(glossitis	O
and	O
other	O
symptoms	O
are	O
listed	O
as	O
possible	O
side	O
effects,	O
although	O
in	O
my	O
case	O
it's	O
been	O
a	O

reaction)	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
did	O
bring	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
down	O
from	O
268	O
to	O
153	O
but	O
I	O
want	O
the	O
glossitis,headaches	O
and	O
dizziness	B-ADR
to	O
go	O
away.	O
I	O
hate	O
feeling	O
this	O
way.	O
I	O
will	O
find	O
another	O
way	O
to	O
control	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
if	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
proves	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
culprit.	O

My	O
doctor	O
says	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
levers	O
are	O
lower.	O
so	O
that's	O
good.	O
But	O
I've	O
been	O
feeling	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
mind	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
fading	I-ADR
away.	O
and	O
it's	O
a	O
scary	O
sensation,	O
when	O
I	O
can't	O
remember	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
co-workers	O
when	O
I'm	O
talking	O
to	O

I	O

I	O

this	O
may	O

I've	O

Some	O

it	O
(10	O

I	O
developed	O
serious	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR

restlessness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

which	O
made	O

I	O
am	O
just	O
glad	O
I	O
stopped	O

it	O
before	O

Yes,	O
it	O
did	O
a	O
great	O

lowering	O
my	O

but	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
are	O
very	O
dangerous	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
think	O
long	O
and	O
hard	O
before	O
taking	O
any	O

I	O
would	O

that	O

Stomach	B-ADR

I	O
took	O

almost	O
fifteen	O

experiencing	O
stomach	B-ADR

that	O
I	O
chalked	O
off	O

I	O
had	O
aches	B-ADR
and	I-ADR

in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

When	O
my	O

upped	O
my	O

to	O
40	O

to	O
treat	O
aggressively	O
a	O
spike	B-Symptom

in	O
three	O

I	O

such	O

that	O
I	O
literally	O
couldn't	B-ADR

more	O

Also,	O
I	O
was	O

I	O
never	O

When	O
I	O

it,	O
the	O

went	O
away,	O
including	O

I	O
had	O
chalked	O
up	O

Terrible	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
hips	I-ADR
and	I-ADR

After	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
year,	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
hip.	O
Told	O
Dr	O
about	O
it,	O
he	O
didn't	O
seem	O
to	O
concerned.	O
After	O
about	O
1	O
1/2	O
years	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

The	O
pain	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
bad	I-ADR
at	O
this	O
point	O
that	O
it	O
wakes	O
me	O
up	O
at	O

and	O
extremely	B-ADR
limits	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
use	I-ADR

my	I-ADR

Dr	O
sent	O
me	O
for	O
x-rays,	O

to	O
see	O
an	O
orthopedic	O

All	O
results	O
negative.	O
They	O
suggested	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
tendonitis	B-Finding
or	O
avascular	B-Finding
necrosis	I-Finding
and	O
recommended	O
anti-inflammatories.	O
Nobody	O
ever	O
suggested	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
drug	O
until	O
I	O
found	O
this	O
site	O
doing	O
research	O
on	O
my	O
pain.	O
It	O
makes	O
me	O
wonder	O
how	O
powerful	O
these	O
drug	O
companies	O
are	O
that	O
doctors	O
won't	O
even	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
problem.	O
I'm	O
stopping	O
this	O

today	O
in	O
the	O
hopes	O
that	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
goes	O
away.	O

I'll	O

I	O
finally	O
discovered	O

two	O
weeks.	O

After	O
four	O
months	O
on	O
20	O
mg	O
suffered	O
calf	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
in	O
middle	O
of	O
night.	O
After	O
6	O
months	O
cut	O
dose	O
in	O
half,	O
still	O
calf	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
once	O
in	O
a	O
while.	O
Now	O
after	O
2+	O
years	O
noticed	O
my	O
left	O
hip	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
bothering	I-ADR
me	O
so	O
that	O
sometimes	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
walk	B-ADR
a	I-ADR
little	I-ADR
funny.	O
Thought	O
I	O
might	O
need	O
hip	O
replacement	O
(age	O
71),	O
but	O
it	O
dawned	O
on	O
me	O
that	O
maybe	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
might	O
be	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
that	O
too.	O
I	O
cut	O
dose	O
again	O
in	O
half	O
and	O
am	O
taking	O
only	O
5	O
mg.	O
Now	O
after	O
one	O
week	O
I	O
notice	O
that	O
hip	B-ADR
does	I-ADR
not	I-ADR
hurt	I-ADR
any	O
more.	O

the	O
first	O
pill	O
i	O
took	O
it	O
caused	O
severe	B-ADR
abdominal	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
but	O
after	O
taking	O
the	O
first	O
one	O
it	O
never	O
did	O
that	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
recently	O
i've	O
been	O
feeling	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
stomach	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
full	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
empty	I-ADR
at	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

i	O
feel	O
its	O
ok.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
10mg	O
for	O
2	O
years.	O
About	O
6	O
mons.	O
ago,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
tell	O
my	O
Dr	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
leg	B-ADR
cramps.	O
He	O
switched	O
to	O
Pravachol	B-Drug
20mg.	O
I	O
lasted	O
about	O
2	O
weeks.	O
The	O
pain	O
was	O
worse.	O
Then	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
the	O
internet	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
causing	O
the	O
pain.	O
It	O
was	O
Statin.	O
I	O
looked	O
that	O
up	O
and	O
found	O
what	O
it	O
does	O
to	O
the	O
body.	O
So,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
any	O
drug	O
and	O
take	O
some	O
Q10	B-Drug
to	O
build	O
my	O
body	O
back	O
up.	O
Two	O
months	O
later	O
went	O
back	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
with	O
the	O
Q10.	O
2	O
months	O
later,	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
back.	O
Twice	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
before,	O
plus	O
a	O
whole	O
bunch	O
of	O
other	O
side	O
effects,	O
you	O
see	O
I'm	O
seriuosly	O
allergic	O
to	O
the	O
Statin.	O
And	O
I	O
know	O
now,	O
why	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
known	O
this,	O
but	O
no	O
one	O
told	O
me	O
about	O
it.	O
When	O
you	O
are	O
taking	O
Statin	O
and	O
drink	O
alcohol	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
increase	O
dramatically.	O
When	O
ever	O
I	O
drank,	O
sipped	O
a	O
little	O
wine,	O
by	O
body	O
hurt	O
so	O
bad,	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
flu.	O
And	O
no	O
Aleve,	O
or	O
pain	O
killer	O
would	O
help.	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
allergic	O
to	O
the	O
alcohol.	O
But	O
now	O
I	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Statin.	O
Here	O
are	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
the	O
side-effects	O
I	O
had,	O
that	O
started	O
slowly	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
years,	O
became	O

During	O
the	O
two	O
years,	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
Lipitor,	O
all	O
these	O
syptoms	O
started	O
out	O
slowly.	O
First	O
came	O
the	O
tinnitus.	O
My	O
Dr	O
sent	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
ear	O
Dr.	O
Found	O
no	O
problem,	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
live	O
with	O
it.	O
Second,	O
came	O
depression,	O
Dr	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Zoloft.	O
Then	O
came	O
the	O
sinus	O
problems,	O
Dr	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Rhinocort.	O
During	O
all	O
this	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
80	O
years	O
old.	O
My	O
neck	B-ADR
hurt,	O
my	O
hips	B-ADR
hurt.	O
We	O
got	O
a	O
$3,000.00	O
sleep	O
by	O
number	O
bed	O
to	O
relieve	O
the	O
pain.	O
Didn't	O
really	O
help.	O
Insomia	B-ADR
was	O
constant.	O
I	O
got	O
hooked	O
on	O
Tylenol	B-Drug
PM.	O
I	O
gained	B-ADR
a	I-ADR
lot	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
weight.	O
Went	O
to	O
Lindora	O
to	O
loss	O
weight,	O
so	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
off	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
Lost	O
40	O
lbs.	O
Dr	O
said	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
prevention.	O
This	O
is	O
when	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
check	O
it	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
internet.	O
When	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
Lipitor,	O
about	O
2	O
months	O
ago,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
small	O
drink	O
of	O
wine	O
at	O
a	O
wedding.	O
That	O
night	O
my	O
body	O
aches	O
were	O
so	O
bad,	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
stand	O
it.	O
Then	O
two	O
days	O
later	O
I	O
came	O
down	O
with	O
bronhitis,	O
and	O
asthma.	O
I	O
have	O
asthma	B-Finding
anyway,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
worse	O
case	O
I've	O
had	O
in	O
13	O
years.	O
Then	O
I	O
had	O
sinus	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
again.	O
My	O
Dr	O
took	O
x-rays	O
for	O
pneumonia	B-Finding
and	O
sinus	B-Finding
infection,	O
Came	O
back	O
clear.	O
My	O
Dr	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
see	O
an	O
ear	O
nose	O
and	O
throat	O
Dr	O
Then	O
my	O
blood	O
pressure	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
198/90.	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
had	O
high	B-ADR
blood	I-ADR
pressure.	O
Dr	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Norvasc.	O
Then	O
I	O
had	O
two	O
horrible	O
nightmares.	O
I	O
finally,	O
went	O
on	O
the	O
internet	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
side	O
effects	O
for	O
Lipitor.	O
When	O
I	O
saw	O
all	O
the	O
side-effects,	O
I	O
nearly	O
died.	O
I	O
have	O
all	O
the	O
syptoms.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
that	O
instant.	O
That	O
was	O
one	O
week	O
ago.	O
I'm	O
starting	O
feel	O
a	O
little	O
better.	O
I've	O
gone	O
to	O
my	O
Dr	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
new	O
about	O
the	O
alcohol	O
related	O
problem.	O
He	O
said,	O
no.	O
There	O
is	O
no	O
warning	O
on	O
the	O
prescription	O
bottle,	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
to	O
watch	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
reaction	O
with	O

The	O
Dr	O
is	O
now	O
doing	O
tests,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
any	O
damage	O
to	O
my	O
heart	O
and	O
muscles.	O
I	O
also,	O
asked	O
for	O
physical	O

for	O
my	O
left	O
shoulder	O
and	O
neck.	O
My	O
left	B-ADR
shoulder	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
almost	I-ADR

I	O
think	O
the	O
tinnitus	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
left	I-ADR
ear	I-ADR
has	O
been	O
caused	O
by	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
hope	O
it	O
goes	O
away	O
soon.	O
I	O
also,	O
lost	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
sense	I-ADR
of	I-ADR

during	O
this	O

I	O
would	O

increased	O
by	O

to	O
consider	O

the	O

Dr	O

about	O

I	O

an	O
a	O
knee	B-ADR
that	I-ADR
was	I-ADR
just	I-ADR
throbbing	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
pain.	O
I	O
hobbled	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
dose	O
of	O
Advil	B-Drug
and	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
sleep	O
after	O
about	O
a	O
half	O
hour.	O
I	O
awoke	O
this	O
morning	O
with	O
about	O
a	O
50%	O
reduction	O
in	O
pain	B-ADR
and	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
subsided	O
as	O
the	O
day	O
goes	O
on.	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
take	O
lipitor	B-Drug
before	O
bed	O
again,	O
I	O
may	O
cut	O
the	O
daily	O
dose	O
in	O
half	O
and	O
possibly	O
stop	O
altogether	O
if	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
persists	O
at	O
an	O
intolerable	O
level.	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
has	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
levels	O
to	O
the	O
180's.	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
reading	O
below	O
218	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
steadily	O
rising	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
years	O
to	O
a	O
consistent	O
level	O
in	O
the	O
240's.	O
The	O
ratio	O
of	O
bad	O
to	O
good	O
cholesterol	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
acceptable	O
zone	O
and	O
never	O
had	O
been	O
before	O
taking	O
lipitor.	O
So,	O
all	O
in	O
all,	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
has	O
done	O
a	O
good	O
job.	O
I	O
will	O
try	O

with	O
the	O
joint	B-ADR

but	O
if	O
it	O
